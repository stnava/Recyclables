\section{Image Processing Methods}

All MRI volumes will be processed using Advanced Normalization Tools
(ANTs) \href{http://www.picsl.upenn.edu/ANTS}{(click here for
link)}\cite{Avants2011a,Avants2011,Murphy2011,Tustison2010,Tustison2011,Tustison2011a}
via previously reported procedures validated as highly accurate
\cite{Klein2009,Klein2010,Murphy2011,Avants2011}.  In general, ANTs-based
processing for multiple modalities is based on, first, defining a
template to guide the population normalization and segmentation
procedures \cite{Avants2011a,Avants2011}.  Traditionally, this
approach was used for single modalities but, more recently, is
exetended for multiple modalities via multiple-modality cohort-specific templates
that capture the average shape and appearance of T1, DTI and
functional images, as in \cite{Kim2010,Avants2011a,Jain2012,Tustison2012}.  We use the
template to guide brain extraction for all modalities and subsequent
tissue or neuroanatomical parcellation \cite{Avants2011a}.  
This general procedure allows several complementary measurements to be
extracted from neuroimaging including: 

\noindent{\em Jacobian-based Volume from T1-weighted MRI:}  Image registration
methods are able to use T1 MRI to obtain voxel-wise measurement of the
subject structural volume relative to a group local template or
relative to a baseline timepoint.  These measurements are used in
Tensor-Based Morphometry (TBM) which, when performed symmetrically as
in my prior work \cite{Yushkevich2010a,Das2012}, is highly accurate
and provides detailed information on shape change over time
\cite{Brambati2007,Hua2011,Kim2013} or across a population \cite{Kim2008,Massimo2009,Morgan2011,Hanson2010,Hanson2012}.

\noindent{\em Cortical thickness from T1-weighted MRI:}  A measurement
that is both sensitive and specific in neurodegeneration
\cite{Stricker2012,Libon2012,McMillan2013} and which is associated
with cognitive decline \cite{Dickerson2011,Avants2010}.  

\noindent{\em Measurements derived from DTI:}  Fractional anisotropy
measurement of white matter integrity that may reveal the connectivity
components of neurodegeneration \cite{Zhang2009}, aging
\cite{Kochunov2011} potentially captures
a different aspect of the disease process \cite{Englund2004} and may
differentiate tau and TDP-43 effects \cite{McMillan2013b}.  Relatedly,
mean, radial or axial diffusion relate to age and cognition \cite{Wu2011,Pal2011,Bava2011,ODwyer2012,Bjoernebekk2012}, neurodegeneration \cite{Salami2012,Whitwell2010}
and are particularly sensitive to TBI \cite{Huang2009,Fox2013}.

\noindent{\em BOLD or ASL Network Analysis:} BOLD-based network analysis
\cite{Spoormaker2010,Sanz-Arigita2010} has emerged as a powerful tool
with specific value in both brain injury
\cite{Mayer2011,Scheibel2012,Zhou2013}, the study of intervention
strategies \cite{Roy2010,FeldsteinEwing2011} and measurement of pain
\cite{Mayhew2013}.  ASL may also be employed in this manner
\cite{Jann2013} and has been processed with ANTs tools and canonical
correlation analysis \cite{Duda2013}.  We propose network measures
based on constant graph density across subjects
which controls for inter-subject variation in base correlation levels
\cite{Liu2008, Power2011, Schwarz2011, Braun2012, Liang2012}. 
On the binarized graphs, we compute betweenness, small-worldness and
related metrics. 

\noindent{\em Cerebral blood flow (CBF) from ASL:}  This functional
quantitative measure (versus the relative values provided by BOLD) has
the potential to reveal alterations in the brain due to injury
\cite{Kim2008}, pain \cite{Howard2011}, pharmacological intervention \cite{Black2010,Jenkins2012} or that precede visible structural change and may
indicate cortical reorganization \cite{Hayward2010}.  ASL-based CBF
also accurately recapitulates PET imaging in Alzheimer's disease \cite{Chen2011,Mak2012}.
CBF is a more repeatable functional measurement than BOLD
\cite{Liu2007,Aguirre2012}, may be used in network analysis in lieu of
or combination with 
BOLD \cite{Duda2013} and provides a unique view on the brain complementary to DTI and T1.
