  abstract = {Accurate cortical thickness estimation is important for the study
	of many neurodegenerative diseases. Many approaches have been previously
	proposed, which can be broadly categorised as mesh-based and voxel-based.
	While the mesh-based approaches can potentially achieve subvoxel
	resolution, they usually lack the computational efficiency needed
	for clinical applications and large database studies. In contrast,
	voxel-based approaches, are computationally efficient, but lack accuracy.
	The aim of this paper is to propose a novel voxel-based method based
	upon the Laplacian definition of thickness that is both accurate
	and computationally efficient. A framework was developed to estimate
	and integrate the partial volume information within the thickness
	estimation process. Firstly, in a Lagrangian step, the boundaries
	are initialized using the partial volume information. Subsequently,
	in an Eulerian step, a pair of partial differential equations are
	solved on the remaining voxels to finally compute the thickness.
	Using partial volume information significantly improved the accuracy
	of the thickness estimation on synthetic phantoms, and improved reproducibility
	on real data. Significant differences in the hippocampus and temporal
	lobe between healthy controls (NC), mild cognitive impaired (MCI)
	and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients were found on clinical data
	from the ADNI database. We compared our method in terms of precision,
	computational speed and statistical power against the Eulerian approach.
	With a slight increase in computation time, accuracy and precision
	were greatly improved. Power analysis demonstrated the ability of
	our method to yield statistically significant results when comparing
	AD and NC. Overall, with our method the number of samples is reduced
	by 25% to find significant differences between the two groups.},

	that perfusion data are composed of independent observations in time
	under the null hypothesis, in contrast to BOLD data, which possess
	marked autocorrelation. We also present a method (sinc subtraction)
	of generating perfusion data from its raw source signal that minimizes
	the presence of oxygen-sensitive signal changes and can be used with
	any experimental design. Empirically, we demonstrate the absence
	of autocorrelation in perfusion noise, examine the shape of the hemodynamic
	response function for BOLD and perfusion, and obtain a measure of
	signal to noise for each method. This information is then used to
	generate a model of relative sensitivity of the BOLD and perfusion
	methods for within-subject experimental designs of varying temporal
	frequency. It is determined that perfusion fMRI provides superior
	sensitivity for within-subject experimental designs that concentrate
	their power at or below approximately 0.009 Hz (corresponding to
	a "blocked" experimental design of 60-s epochs). Additionally, evidence
	is presented that across-subject hypothesis tests may be more sensitive

  abstract = {RPE65 is an essential molecule in the retinoid-visual cycle, and RPE65
	gene mutations cause the congenital human blindness known as Leber
	congenital amaurosis (LCA). Somatic gene therapy delivered to the
	retina of blind dogs with an RPE65 mutation dramatically restores
	retinal physiology and has sparked international interest in human
	treatment trials for this incurable disease. An unanswered question
	is how the visual cortex responds after prolonged sensory deprivation
	from retinal dysfunction. We therefore studied the cortex of RPE65-mutant
	dogs before and after retinal gene therapy. Then, we inquired whether
	there is visual pathway integrity and responsivity in adult humans
	with LCA due to RPE65 mutations (RPE65-LCA).RPE65-mutant dogs were
	studied with fMRI. Prior to therapy, retinal and subcortical responses
	to light were markedly diminished, and there were minimal cortical
	responses within the primary visual areas of the lateral gyrus (activation
	amplitude mean +/- standard deviation [SD] = 0.07\% +/- 0.06\% and
	volume = 1.3 +/- 0.6 cm(3)). Following therapy, retinal and subcortical
	response restoration was accompanied by increased amplitude (0.18\%
	+/- 0.06\%) and volume (8.2 +/- 0.8 cm(3)) of activation within the
	lateral gyrus (p < 0.005 for both). Cortical recovery occurred rapidly
	(within a month of treatment) and was persistent (as long as 2.5
	y after treatment). Recovery was present even when treatment was
	provided as late as 1-4 y of age. Human RPE65-LCA patients (ages
	18-23 y) were studied with structural magnetic resonance imaging.
	Optic nerve diameter (3.2 +/- 0.5 mm) was within the normal range
	(3.2 +/- 0.3 mm), and occipital cortical white matter density as
	judged by voxel-based morphometry was slightly but significantly
	altered (1.3 SD below control average, p = 0.005). Functional magnetic
	resonance imaging in human RPE65-LCA patients revealed cortical responses
	with a markedly diminished activation volume (8.8 +/- 1.2 cm(3))
	compared to controls (29.7 +/- 8.3 cm(3), p < 0.001) when stimulated
	with lower intensity light. Unexpectedly, cortical response volume
	(41.2 +/- 11.1 cm(3)) was comparable to normal (48.8 +/- 3.1 cm(3),
	p = 0.2) with higher intensity light stimulation.Visual cortical
	responses dramatically improve after retinal gene therapy in the
	canine model of RPE65-LCA. Human RPE65-LCA patients have preserved
	visual pathway anatomy and detectable cortical activation despite
	limited visual experience. Taken together, the results support the
	potential for human visual benefit from retinal therapies currently
	being aimed at restoring vision to the congenitally blind with genetic
	retinal disease.},

	image registration. It is implemented for both 2D and 3D image registration
	and has been formulated to include an option for estimating inverse
	consistent deformations. Nonlinear registration is considered as
	a local optimisation problem, which is solved using a Levenberg-Marquardt
	strategy. The necessary matrix solutions are obtained in reasonable
	time using a multigrid method. A constant Eulerian velocity framework
	is used, which allows a rapid scaling and squaring method to be used
	in the computations. DARTEL has been applied to intersubject registration
	of 471 whole brain images, and the resulting deformations were evaluated
	in terms of how well they encode the shape information necessary
	to separate male and female subjects and to predict the ages of the
	subjects.},

	use on adolescent brain development, particularly on the hippocampus.
	In this preliminary study, we compared hippocampal morphology in
	14 "treatment-seeking" adolescents (aged 18-20) with a history of
	prior heavy cannabis use (5.8 joints/day) after an average of 6.7
	months of drug abstinence, and 14 demographically matched normal
	controls. Participants underwent a high-resolution 3D MRI as well
	as cognitive testing including the California Verbal Learning Test
	(CVLT). Heavy-cannabis users showed significantly smaller volumes
	of the right (p < 0.04) and left (p < 0.02) hippocampus, but no significant
	differences in the amygdala region compared to controls. In controls,
	larger hippocampus volumes were observed to be significantly correlated
	with higher CVLT verbal learning and memory scores, but these relationships
	were not observed in cannabis users. In cannabis users, a smaller
	right hippocampus volume was correlated with a higher amount of cannabis
	use (r = -0.57, p < 0.03). These data support a hypothesis that heavy
	cannabis use may have an adverse effect on hippocampus development.
	These findings, after an average 6.7 month of supervised abstinence,
	lend support to a theory that cannabis use may impart long-term structural
	and functional damage. Alternatively, the observed hippocampal volumetric
	abnormalities may represent a risk factor for cannabis dependence.
	These data have potential significance for understanding the observed
	relationship between early cannabis exposure during adolescence and
	subsequent development of adult psychopathology reported in the literature
	for schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.},

	a representative image or set of images from the time series into
	an optimal template space. The template mapping is then combined
	with the intrasubject spatiotemporal map to enable pairwise statistical
	tests to be performed on a population of normalized time series images.
	Here, we apply this longitudinal analysis protocol to study the gray
	matter atrophy patterns induced by frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
	We sample our normalized spatiotemporal maps at baseline (time zero)
	and time one year to generate an annualized atrophy map (AAM) that
	estimates the annual effect of FTD. This spatiotemporal normalization
	enables us to locate neuroanatomical regions that consistently undergo
	significant annual gray matter atrophy across the population. We
	found the majority of annual atrophy to occur in the frontal and
	temporal lobes in our population of 20 subjects. We also found significant

	resolution T1-weighted imaging, in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal
	dementia (FTD). This process is based on a novel computational model
	derived from sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) that allows
	us to automatically identify mutually predictive, distributed neuroanatomical
	regions from different imaging modalities. We apply the SCCA model
	to a dataset that includes 23 control subjects that are demographically
	matched to 49 subjects with autopsy or CSF-biomarker-diagnosed AD
	(n=24) and FTD (n=25) with both DTI and T1-weighted structural imaging.
	SCCA shows that the FTD-related frontal and temporal degeneration
	pattern is correlated across modalities with permutation corrected
	p<0.0005. In AD, we find significant association between cortical
	thinning and reduction in white matter integrity within a distributed

  abstract = {One of the most challenging problems in modern neuroimaging is detailed
	characterization of neurodegeneration. Quantifying spatial and longitudinal
	atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These
	spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related
	diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease
	(AD), which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here,
	we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method (SyN) for
	maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic
	maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations necessary for this
	optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method.
	Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to
	contrast SyN's performance with a related elastic method and with
	the standard ITK implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The
	new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular
	when the distance between the template brain and the target brain
	is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic
	cortical labelings of FTD and control subjects with those gained
	by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods
	tested, SyN's volume measurements are the most strongly correlated
	with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates
	that SyN, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing
	and making anatomical measurements in volumetric MRI of patients
	and at-risk elderly individuals.},

	effects secondary to fetal hypoxemia, or altered cerebrovascular

	Our results indicate that the caudate is significantly larger in

  abstract = {Sophisticated image analysis methods have been developed for the human
	brain, but such tools still need to be adapted and optimized for
	quantitative small animal imaging. We propose a framework for quantitative
	anatomical phenotyping in mouse models of neurological and psychiatric
	conditions. The framework encompasses an atlas space, image acquisition
	protocols, and software tools to register images into this space.
	We show that a suite of segmentation tools (Avants, Epstein et al.,
	2008) designed for human neuroimaging can be incorporated into a
	pipeline for segmenting mouse brain images acquired with multispectral
	magnetic resonance imaging (MR) protocols. We present a flexible
	approach for segmenting such hyperimages, optimizing registration,
	and identifying optimal combinations of image channels for particular
	structures. Brain imaging with T1, T2* and T2 contrasts yielded accuracy
	in the range of 83\% for hippocampus and caudate putamen (Hc and
	CPu), but only 54\% in white matter tracts, and 44\% for the ventricles.
	The addition of diffusion tensor parameter images improved accuracy
	for large gray matter structures (by >5\%), white matter (10\%),
	and ventricles (15\%). The use of Markov random field segmentation
	further improved overall accuracy in the C57BL/6 strain by 6\%; so
	Dice coefficients for Hc and CPu reached 93\%, for white matter 79\%,
	for ventricles 68\%, and for substantia nigra 80\%. We demonstrate
	the segmentation pipeline for the widely used C57BL/6 strain, and
	two test strains (BXD29, APP/TTA). This approach appears promising
	for characterizing temporal changes in mouse models of human neurological
	and psychiatric conditions, and may provide anatomical constraints
	for other preclinical imaging, e.g. fMRI and molecular imaging. This
	is the first demonstration that multiple MR imaging modalities combined
	with multivariate segmentation methods lead to significant improvements
	in anatomical segmentation in the mouse brain.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In elderly depression, volumetric brain imaging findings
	suggest abnormalities of the frontal lobe, particularly the orbitofrontal
	cortex, and the hippocampus. No studies to date have mapped cortical
	abnormalities over the entire brain surface in major depression.
	Here, we conducted detailed spatial analyses of brain size and gray
	matter within the cortical mantle in elderly patients with major
	depression. METHODS: High-resolution, three-dimensional, structural
	magnetic resonance imaging data and cortical pattern matching methods
	were used in 24 depressed elderly patients and 19 group-matched controls
	to measure local brain size and proportions of gray matter at thousands
	of homologous cortical surface locations. RESULTS: Prominent brain
	size reductions were observed in the depressed subjects in the orbitofrontal
	cortex bilaterally. Cortical gray matter measurements revealed significant
	gray matter increases in the orbitofrontal cortex, adjacent to focal
	trend level significant decreases of gray matter in the same region.
	Depressed patients also exhibited significant gray matter increases
	in parietal cortices, as well as the left temporal cortex. CONCLUSIONS:
	Complex cortical changes may contribute to the brain size reduction
	of the orbitofrontal cortex and to the gray matter abnormalities
	detected in orbitofrontal cortex and temporoparietal cortices, thereby
	providing a potentially new window into the pathophysiology of elderly
	depression.},

	these injuries have long-term health effects. However, the difficulty

	In the following experiments, we present the results of diffusion
	tensor imaging (DTI) and histological analysis of a model of mild
	repetitive closed-skull brain injury in mouse. Histological markers
	used included silver staining and amyloid precursor protein (APP)
	immunohistochemistry to detect axonal injury, and Iba-1 immunohistochemistry
	to assess microglial activation. At 24h post-injury, before silver
	staining or microglial abnormalities were apparent by histology,
	no significant changes in any of the DTI parameters were observed
	within white matter. At 7 days post-injury we observed a reduction
	in axial and mean diffusivity. Relative anisotropy at 7 days correlated
	strongly with the degree of silver staining. Interestingly, APP was
	not observed at any timepoint examined. In addition to the white
	matter alterations, mean diffusivity was elevated in ipsilateral
	cortex at 24h but returned to sham levels by 7 days. Altogether,
	this demonstrates that DTI is a sensitive method for detecting axonal
	injury despite a lack of conventional APP pathology. Further, this
	reflects a need to better understand the histological basis for DTI
	signal changes in mild TBI.},

	disease (PD) and animal models. Rodent studies support the hypothesis
	that A(2a) antagonists produce this benefit by reducing the inhibitory
	output of the basal ganglia indirect pathway. One way to test this
	hypothesis in humans is to quantify regional pharmacodynamic responses
	with cerebral blood flow (CBF) imaging. That approach has also been
	proposed as a tool to accelerate pharmaceutical dose finding, but
	has not yet been applied in humans to drugs in development. We successfully
	addressed both these aims with a perfusion magnetic resonance imaging
	(MRI) study of the novel adenosine A(2a) antagonist SYN115. During
	a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in
	21 PD patients on levodopa but no agonists, we acquired pulsed arterial
	spin labeling MRI at the end of each treatment period. SYN115 produced
	a highly significant decrease in thalamic CBF, consistent with reduced
	pallidothalamic inhibition via the indirect pathway. Similar decreases
	occurred in cortical regions whose activity decreases with increased
	alertness and externally focused attention, consistent with decreased
	self-reported sleepiness on SYN115. Remarkably, we also derived quantitative
	pharmacodynamic parameters from the CBF responses to SYN115. These
	results suggested that the doses tested were on the low end of the
	effective dose range, consistent with clinical data reported separately.
	We conclude that (1) SYN115 enters the brain and exerts dose-dependent
	regional effects, (2) the most prominent of these effects is consistent
	with deactivation of the indirect pathway as predicted by preclinical
	studies; and (3) perfusion MRI can provide rapid, quantitative, clinically
	relevant dose-finding information for pharmaceutical development.},

  month = {May},
  abstract = {Individuals with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) often have deficits
	in processing speed and working memory (WM) and there is a growing
	literature using functional imaging studies to document these deficits.
	However, divergent results from these studies revealed both hypoactivation
	and hyperactivation of neural resources after injury. We hypothesized
	that at least part of this variance can be explained by distinct
	demands between WM tasks. Notably, in this literature some WM tasks
	use discrete periods of encoding, maintenance, and retrieval, whereas
	others place continuous demands on WM. The purpose of this meta-analysis
	is to examine the differences in neural recruitment after mTBI to
	determine if divergent findings can be explained as a function of
	task demand and cognitive load. A comprehensive literature review
	revealed 14 studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging to
	examine brain activity of individuals with mTBI during working memory
	tasks. Three of the fourteen studies included reported hypoactivity,
	five reported hyperactivity, and the remaining six reported both
	hypoactivity and hyperactivity. Studies were grouped according to
	task type and submitted to GingerALE maximum likelihood meta-analyses
	to determine the most consistent brain activation patterns. The primary
	findings from this meta-analysis suggest that the discrepancy in
	activation patterns is at least partially attributable to the classification
	of WM task, with hyperactivation being observed in continuous tasks
	and hypoactivation being observed during discrete tasks. We anticipate
	that differential task load expressed in continuous and discrete
	WM tasks contributes to these differences. Implications for the interpretation
	of fMRI signals in clinical samples are discussed. (JINS, 2013, 19,

	increase the signal-to-noise ratio. When the observations lie on
	a convoluted brain surface, however, it is more natural to assign

	therefore develop a framework for geodesic distance-based kernel
	smoothing and statistical analysis on the cortical manifolds. As

	We assess reproducibility, and show that FreeSurfer has a regional
	standard deviation of thickness difference on same day scans that

	method and discuss the trade off between reproducibility and segmentation
	accuracy caused by bending energy constraints. We demonstrate that
	voxel-based methods can detect similar patterns of group-wise differences
	as well as FreeSurfer in typical applications such as producing group-wise
	maps of statistically significant thickness change, but that regional
	statistics can vary between methods. We use a Support Vector Machine
	to classify patients against controls and did not find statistically
	significantly different results with voxel based methods compared

	procedure is robust against variability in the image quality through
	a non-parametric implementation: no assumptions are made about the
	tissue intensity distributions. The performance of this brain tissue
	classification procedure is demonstrated through quantitative and

	and polysomnographic findings to identify variables that correlated
	with the development of specific sleep disorders.Of 116 consecutive

	27.8 ± 4.1 kg/m²), and 29.5\% and 70.5\% sustained blunt and blast
	injuries, respectively. Nearly all (97.4\%) reported sleep complaints.
	Hypersomnia and sleep fragmentation were reported in 85.2\% and 54.3\%,
	respectively. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) was found in
	34.5\%, and 55.2\% had insomnia. Patients with blast injuries developed
	more anxiety (50.6\% vs 20.0\%, P = .002) and insomnia (63\% vs 40\%,
	P = .02), whereas patients with blunt trauma had significantly more
	OSAS (54.3\% vs 25.9\%, P = .003). In multivariate analysis, blunt
	trauma was a significant predictor of OSAS (OR, 3.09; 95\% CI, 1.02-9.38;
	P = .047).Sleep disruption is common following traumatic brain injury,
	and the majority of patients develop a chronic sleep disorder. It
	appears that sleep disturbances may be influenced by the mechanism

	blunt injury potentially predicting the development of OSAS.},

  abstract = {In both diagnostic and research applications, the interpretation of
	MR images of the human brain is facilitated when different data sets
	can be compared by visual inspection of equivalent anatomical planes.
	Quantitative analysis with predefined atlas templates often requires
	the initial alignment of atlas and image planes. Unfortunately, the
	axial planes acquired during separate scanning sessions are often
	different in their relative position and orientation, and these slices
	are not coplanar with those in the atlas. We have developed a completely
	automatic method to register a given volumetric data set with Talairach
	stereotaxic coordinate system.The registration method is based on
	multi-scale, three-dimensional (3D) cross-correlation with an average
	(n > 300) MR brain image volume aligned with the Talariach stereotaxic
	space. Once the data set is re-sampled by the transformation recovered
	by the algorithm, atlas slices can be directly superimposed on the
	corresponding slices of the re-sampled volume. the use of such a
	standardized space also allows the direct comparison, voxel to voxel,
	of two or more data sets brought into stereotaxic space.With use
	of a two-tailed Student t test for paired samples, there was no significant
	difference in the transformation parameters recovered by the automatic
	algorithm when compared with two manual landmark-based methods (p
	> 0.1 for all parameters except y-scale, where p > 0.05). Using root-mean-square
	difference between normalized voxel intensities as an unbiased measure
	of registration, we show that when estimated and averaged over 60
	volumetric MR images in standard space, this measure was 30\% lower
	for the automatic technique than the manual method, indicating better
	registrations. Likewise, the automatic method showed a 57\% reduction
	in standard deviation, implying a more stable technique. The algorithm
	is able to recover the transformation even when data are missing
	from the top or bottom of the volume.We present a fully automatic
	registration method to map volumetric data into stereotaxic space
	that yields results comparable with those of manually based techniques.
	The method requires no manual identification of points or contours
	and therefore does not suffer the drawbacks involved in user intervention
	such as reproducibility and interobserver variability.},

  abstract = {The hippocampal formation (HF) is a brain structure of great interest
	because of its central role in learning and memory, and its associated
	vulnerability to several neurological disorders. In vivo oblique
	coronal T2-weighted MRI with high in-plane resolution (~0.5 mm ×
	0.5 mm), thick slices (~2.0 mm), and a field of view tailored to
	imaging the hippocampal formation (denoted HF-MRI in this paper)
	has been advanced as a useful imaging modality for detailed hippocampal
	morphometry. Cross-sectional analysis of volume measurements derived
	from HF-MRI has shown the modality's promise to yield sensitive imaging-based
	biomarker for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.
	However, the utility of this modality for making measurements of
	longitudinal change has not yet been demonstrated. In this paper,
	using an unbiased deformation-based morphometry (DBM) pipeline, we
	examine the suitability of HF-MRI for estimating longitudinal change
	by comparing atrophy rates measured in the whole hippocampus from
	this modality with those measured from more common isotropic (~1
	mm³) T1-weighted MRI in the same set of individuals, in a cohort
	of healthy controls and patients with cognitive impairment. While
	measurements obtained from HF-MRI were largely consistent with those
	obtained from T1-MRI, HF-MRI yielded slightly larger group effect
	of greater atrophy rates in patients than in controls. The estimated
	minimum sample size required for detecting a 25\% change in patients'
	atrophy rate in the hippocampus compared to the control group with
	a statistical power ?=0.8 was N=269. For T1-MRI, the equivalent sample
	size was N=325. Using a dataset of test-retest scans, we show that
	the measurements were free of additive bias. We also demonstrate
	that these results were not a confound of certain methodological
	choices made in the DBM pipeline to address the challenges of making
	longitudinal measurements from HF-MRI, using a region of interest
	(ROI) around the HF to globally align serial images, followed by
	slice-by-slice deformable registration to measure local volume change.
	Additionally, we present a preliminary study of atrophy rate measurements
	within hippocampal subfields using HF-MRI. Cross-sectional differences
	in atrophy rates were detected in several subfields.},

	lobe epilepsy (TLE). Region of interest (ROI)-based analysis has
	traditionally been used to study hippocampal involvement in TLE,
	although spatial variation of structural and functional pathology
	have been known to exist within the ROI. In this article, structure-specific
	analysis (Yushkevich et al. (2007) Neuroimage 35:1516-1530) is applied
	to the study of both structure and function in TLE patients. This
	methodology takes into account information about the spatial correspondence
	of voxels within ROIs on left and right sides of the same subject
	as well as between subjects. Hippocampal thickness is studied as
	a measure of structural integrity, and functional activation in a
	functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment in which
	subjects performed a memory encoding task is studied as a measure
	of functional integrity. Pronounced disease-related decrease in thickness
	is found in posterior and anterior hippocampus. A region in the body
	also shows increased thickness in patients' healthy hippocampi compared
	with controls. Functional activation in diseased hippocampi is reduced
	in the body region compared to controls, whereas a region in the
	tail showing greater right-lateralized activation in controls also
	shows greater activation in healthy hippocampi compared with the
	diseased side in patients. Summary measurements generated by integrating
	quantities of interest over the entire hippocampus can also be used,
	as is done in conventional ROI analysis.},

	(SSC) of patients with migraine. METHODS: Cortical thickness of the
	SSC of patients with migraine was measured in vivo and compared with
	age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. The cohort was composed of
	24 patients with migraine, subdivided into 12 patients who had migraine
	with aura, 12 patients who had migraine without aura, and 12 controls.
	Group and individual analyses were performed in the SSC and shown
	as average maps of significant changes in cortical thickness. RESULTS:
	Migraineurs had on average thicker SSCs than the control group. The
	most significant thickness changes were noticed in the caudal SSC,
	where the trigeminal area, including head and face, is somatotopically
	represented. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate the presence of interictal
	structural changes in the somatosensory cortex (SSC) of migraineurs.
	The SSC plays a crucial role in the noxious and nonnoxious somatosensory
	processing. Thickening in the SSC is in line with diffusional abnormalities
	observed in the subcortical trigeminal somatosensory pathway of the
	same migraine cohort in a previous study. Repetitive migraine attacks
	may lead to, or be the result of, neuroplastic changes in cortical
	and subcortical structures of the trigeminal somatosensory system.},

	the two dementias based on volumetric measurements of brain atrophy

	of cortical thinning improve the differentiation between Alzheimer's
	disease and FTD is unclear. In this study, we measured cortical thickness
	using a set of automated tools (Freesurfer) to reconstruct the brain's
	cortical surface from T1-weighted structural MRI data in 22 patients
	with Alzheimer's disease, 19 patients with FTD and 23 cognitively
	normal subjects. The goals were to detect the characteristic patterns
	of cortical thinning in these two types of dementia, to test the
	relationship between cortical thickness and cognitive impairment,
	to determine if measurement of cortical thickness is better than
	that of cortical volume for differentiating between these dementias
	and normal ageing and improving the classification of Alzheimer's
	disease and FTD based on neuropsychological scores alone. Compared
	to cognitively normal subjects, Alzheimer's disease patients had
	a thinner cortex primarily in bilateral, frontal, parietal, temporal
	and occipital lobes (P < 0.001), while FTD patients had a thinner
	cortex in bilateral, frontal and temporal regions and some thinning
	in inferior parietal regions and the posterior cingulate (P < 0.001).
	Compared to FTD patients, Alzheimer's disease patients had a thinner
	cortex (P < 0.001) in parts of bilateral parietal and precuneus regions.
	Cognitive impairment was negatively correlated with cortical thickness
	of frontal, parietal and temporal lobes in Alzheimer's disease, while
	similar correlations were not significant in FTD. Measurement of
	cortical thickness was similar to that of cortical volume in differentiating
	between normal ageing, Alzheimer's disease and FTD. Furthermore,
	cortical thickness measurements significantly improved the classification
	between Alzheimer's disease and FTD based on neuropsychological scores
	alone, including the Mini-Mental State Examination and a modified

  abstract = {The core concept within the field of brain mapping is the use of a
	standardized, or "stereotaxic", 3D coordinate frame for data analysis
	and reporting of findings from neuroimaging experiments. This simple
	construct allows brain researchers to combine data from many subjects
	such that group-averaged signals, be they structural or functional,
	can be detected above the background noise that would swamp subtle
	signals from any single subject. Where the signal is robust enough
	to be detected in individuals, it allows for the exploration of inter-individual
	variance in the location of that signal. From a larger perspective,
	it provides a powerful medium for comparison and/or combination of
	brain mapping findings from different imaging modalities and laboratories
	around the world. Finally, it provides a framework for the creation
	of large-scale neuroimaging databases or "atlases" that capture the
	population mean and variance in anatomical or physiological metrics
	as a function of age or disease. However, while the above benefits
	are not in question at first order, there are a number of conceptual
	and practical challenges that introduce second-order incompatibilities
	among experimental data. Stereotaxic mapping requires two basic components:
	(i) the specification of the 3D stereotaxic coordinate space, and
	(ii) a mapping function that transforms a 3D brain image from "native"
	space, i.e. the coordinate frame of the scanner at data acquisition,
	to that stereotaxic space. The first component is usually expressed
	by the choice of a representative 3D MR image that serves as target
	"template" or atlas. The native image is re-sampled from native to
	stereotaxic space under the mapping function that may have few or
	many degrees of freedom, depending upon the experimental design.
	The optimal choice of atlas template and mapping function depend
	upon considerations of age, gender, hemispheric asymmetry, anatomical
	correspondence, spatial normalization methodology and disease-specificity.
	Accounting, or not, for these various factors in defining stereotaxic
	space has created the specter of an ever-expanding set of atlases,
	customized for a particular experiment, that are mutually incompatible.
	These difficulties continue to plague the brain mapping field. This
	review article summarizes the evolution of stereotaxic space in term
	of the basic principles and associated conceptual challenges, the
	creation of population atlases and the future trends that can be
	expected in atlas evolution.},

  abstract = {A multivariate classification approach has been presented to examine
	the brain abnormalities, i.e., due to prenatal cocaine exposure,
	using both structural and functional brain images. First, a regional
	statistical feature extraction scheme was adopted to capture discriminative
	features from voxel-wise morphometric and functional representations
	of brain images, in order to reduce the dimensionality of the features
	used for classification, as well as to achieve the robustness to
	registration error and inter-subject variations. Then, this feature
	extraction method was used in conjunction with a hybrid feature selection
	method and a nonlinear support vector machine for the classification
	of brain abnormalities. This brain classification approach has been
	applied to detecting the brain abnormality associated with prenatal
	cocaine exposure in adolescents. A promising classification performance
	was achieved on a data set of 49 subjects (24 normal and 25 prenatally
	cocaine-exposed teenagers), with a leave-one-out cross-validation.
	Experimental results demonstrated the efficacy of our method, as
	well as the importance of incorporating both structural and functional
	images for brain classification. Moreover, spatial patterns of group
	difference derived from the constructed classifier were mostly consistent
	with the results of the conventional statistical analysis method.
	Therefore, the proposed approach provided not only a multivariate
	classification method for detecting brain abnormalities, but also
	an alternative way for group analysis of multimodality images.},

	hierarchical organization of a script. Functional magnetic resonance
	imaging associated this with bilateral inferior frontal activation.
	Patients with progressive nonfluent aphasia or behavior-variant frontotemporal
	dementia did not distinguish between event pairs from the same cluster

  abstract = {The vervet monkey is an important nonhuman primate model that allows
	the study of isolated environmental factors in a controlled environment.
	Analysis of monkey MRI often suffers from lower quality images compared
	with human MRI because clinical equipment is typically used to image
	the smaller monkey brain and higher spatial resolution is required.
	This, together with the anatomical differences of the monkey brains,
	complicates the use of neuroimage analysis pipelines tuned for human
	MRI analysis. In this paper we developed an open source image analysis
	framework based on the tools available within the 3D Slicer software
	to support a biological study that investigates the effect of chronic
	ethanol exposure on brain morphometry in a longitudinally followed
	population of male vervets. We first developed a computerized atlas
	of vervet monkey brain MRI, which was used to encode the typical
	appearance of the individual brain structures in MRI and their spatial
	distribution. The atlas was then used as a spatial prior during automatic
	segmentation to process two longitudinal scans per subject. Our evaluation
	confirms the consistency and reliability of the automatic segmentation.
	The comparison of atlas construction strategies reveals that the
	use of a population-specific atlas leads to improved accuracy of
	the segmentation for subcortical brain structures. The contribution
	of this work is twofold. First, we describe an image processing workflow
	specifically tuned towards the analysis of vervet MRI that consists
	solely of the open source software tools. Second, we develop a digital
	atlas of vervet monkey brain MRIs to enable similar studies that
	rely on the vervet model.},

  abstract = {Current work in motivational interviewing (MI) has supported the role
	of in-session client and therapist language in predicting postintervention
	substance use outcomes. In particular, a relationship has been found
	between specific therapist language (e.g., MI-consistent behaviors),
	specific types of client speech (e.g., change talk; CT and counterchange
	talk; CCT), and subsequent drinking outcomes. One hypothesis to explain
	this phenomenon is that CT is an indication of a neurocognitive shift
	that happens during the course of a psychosocial intervention. And,
	it is possible that this shift is responsible for catalyzing and
	maintaining changes in drinking behaviors following MI interventions.
	To investigate this question, the effect of CT on blood oxygen level-dependent
	(BOLD) response during the presentation of alcohol cues was evaluated
	using functional magnetic resonance imaging.To examine changes in
	neural response to alcohol cues following client language, 10 adults
	with alcohol dependence (50\% men; 40\% Caucasian; 40\% Hispanic;
	M age = 42.6; M years of education = 13.3) were presented with CT
	and CCT derived from their prescan MI session during the presentation
	of alcohol cues.Following CCT, there was significant neural response
	to alcohol cues in several key reward areas (cluster-corrected p
	< 0.05, z > 2.3; orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, anterior
	insula, posterior insula, caudate, and putamen). On the contrary,
	there were no areas of significant reward activation following CT.These
	results indicate that CT may be effectively inhibiting activation
	in brain regions that respond to the salience of alcohol cues. These
	findings provide preliminary biological support of the psychosocial
	literature findings, highlighting the critical importance of change
	talk during psychosocial interventions.},

	a variety of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Manual
	methods for estimating cortical thickness from neuroimaging data
	are labor intensive, requiring several days of effort by a trained
	anatomist. Furthermore, the highly folded nature of the cortex is
	problematic for manual techniques, frequently resulting in measurement
	errors in regions in which the cortical surface is not perpendicular

	to obtain accurate thickness estimates for the entire cortex in individual

	Here, we present an automated method for accurately measuring the
	thickness of the cerebral cortex across the entire brain and for
	generating cross-subject statistics in a coordinate system based
	on cortical anatomy. The intersubject standard deviation of the thickness
	measures is shown to be less than 0.5 mm, implying the ability to
	detect focal atrophy in small populations or even individual subjects.
	The reliability and accuracy of this new method are assessed by within-subject

	examined alcohol-associated atrophy using cortical thickness measurements

	surface. METHODS: We compared cortical thickness measures from 31
	abstinent individuals with a history of prior alcohol abuse to 34
	healthy nonalcoholic control participants (total sample size = 65).
	Cortical surface models were created from high-resolution T1-weighted
	images, and cortical thickness was then estimated as the distance
	between the gray matter/white matter boundary and the outer cortical
	surface. RESULTS: Abstinent alcoholics showed reduced whole-brain
	thickness as compared to nonalcoholic participants. Decreases in
	thickness were found bilaterally in (i) superior frontal, (ii) precentral,
	(iii) postcentral, (iv) middle frontal, (v) middle/superior temporal,
	(vi) middle temporal, and (vii) lateral occipital cortical regions.
	Decreased cortical thickness in the alcoholic group was associated
	with severity of alcohol abuse. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate
	widespread reduction in cortical thickness as a consequence of chronic

	for relative pitch processing using two morphometric techniques.
	Cortical differences have been reported in musicians within right
	auditory cortex (AC), a region considered important for pitch-based
	processing, and we have previously reported a functional correlation
	between relative pitch processing in the anterior intraparietal sulcus
	(IPS). We addressed the hypothesis that regional variation of cortical
	structure within AC and IPS is related to relative pitch ability
	using two anatomical techniques, cortical thickness (CT) analysis
	and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of magnetic resonance imaging data.
	Persons with variable amounts of formal musical training were tested
	on a melody transposition task, as well as two musical control tasks
	and a speech control task. We found that gray matter concentration
	and cortical thickness in right Heschl's sulcus and bilateral IPS
	both predicted relative pitch task performance and correlated to
	a lesser extent with performance on the two musical control tasks.
	After factoring out variance explained by musical training, only
	relative pitch performance was predicted by cortical structure in
	these regions. These results directly demonstrate the functional
	relevance of previously reported anatomical differences in the auditory
	cortex of musicians. The findings in the IPS provide further support
	for the existence of a multimodal network for systematic transformation

	with a small deformation, linear elastic model was used to jointly
	estimate correspondences between a set of MRI images. The performance
	of pair-wise and group-wise registration algorithms was evaluated
	for spatial normalization of structural and functional MRI data.
	Traditional spatial normalization is accomplished by group-to-reference
	(G2R) registration in which a group of images are registered pair-wise
	to a reference image. G2R registration is limited due to bias associated
	with selecting a reference image. In contrast, implicit reference
	group-wise (IRG) registration estimates correspondences between a
	group of images by jointly registering the images to an implicit
	reference corresponding to the group average. The implicit reference
	is estimated during IRG registration eliminating the bias associated
	with selecting a specific reference image. Registration performance
	was evaluated using segmented T1-weighted magnetic resonance images
	from the Nonrigid Image Registration Evaluation Project (NIREP),
	DTI and fMRI images. Implicit reference pair-wise (IRP) registration-a
	special case of IRG registration for two images-is shown to produce
	better relative overlap than IRG for pair-wise registration using
	the same small deformation, linear elastic registration model. However,
	IRP-G2R registration is shown to have significant transitivity error,
	i.e., significant inconsistencies between correspondences defined
	by different pair-wise transformations. In contrast, IRG registration
	produces consistent correspondence between images in a group at the
	cost of slightly reduced pair-wise RO accuracy compared to IRP-G2R.
	IRG spatial normalization of the fractional anisotropy (FA) maps
	of DTI is shown to have smaller FA variance compared with G2R methods
	using the same elastic registration model. Analyses of fMRI data
	sets with sensorimotor and visual tasks show that IRG registration,
	on average, increases the statistical detectability of brain activation
	compared to G2R registration.},

  abstract = {Peer-reviewed publications are the primary mechanism for sharing scientific
	results. The current peer-review process is, however, fraught with
	many problems that undermine the pace, validity, and credibility
	of science. We highlight five salient problems: (1) reviewers are
	expected to have comprehensive expertise; (2) reviewers do not have
	sufficient access to methods and materials to evaluate a study; (3)
	reviewers are neither identified nor acknowledged; (4) there is no
	measure of the quality of a review; and (5) reviews take a lot of
	time, and once submitted cannot evolve. We propose that these problems
	can be resolved by making the following changes to the review process.
	Distributing reviews to many reviewers would allow each reviewer
	to focus on portions of the article that reflect the reviewer's specialty
	or area of interest and place less of a burden on any one reviewer.
	Providing reviewers materials and methods to perform comprehensive
	evaluation would facilitate transparency, greater scrutiny, and replication
	of results. Acknowledging reviewers makes it possible to quantitatively
	assess reviewer contributions, which could be used to establish the
	impact of the reviewer in the scientific community. Quantifying review
	quality could help establish the importance of individual reviews
	and reviewers as well as the submitted article. Finally, we recommend
	expediting post-publication reviews and allowing for the dialog to
	continue and flourish in a dynamic and interactive manner. We argue
	that these solutions can be implemented by adapting existing features
	from open-source software management and social networking technologies.
	We propose a model of an open, interactive review system that quantifies
	the significance of articles, the quality of reviews, and the reputation

	when it occurs in sports, produces persistent cognitive problems
	in at least 15\% of patients. Unfortunately, conventional neuropsychological
	tests usually yield results within normal limits in this population.
	The main objective of this event-related potential (ERP) study was
	to understand brain functioning during the performance of a working
	memory (WM) task in patients who have sustained an MTBI, mostly due
	to motor vehicle accident or sports concussion. This study also aimed
	for a better understanding of the association between brain functioning
	as measured with ERP, behavioral performance on the WM task, postconcussion
	symptoms, type of injury (that is, sports concussion vs other types),
	and time since the injury.Forty-four patients with MTBI (7.6 ± 8.4
	months postinjury) were tested on a visual WM task with simultaneous
	recording of ERP, and were compared with 40 control volunteers who
	were their equivalent for age and sex. Amplitude and latency of frontal
	(N200 and N350) and parietal (P200 and P300) ERP waves were measured
	and were compared between groups. Correlation analyses were also
	performed between ERP characteristics, clinical variables, and behavioral
	performance.A significant group difference was found for behavioral
	performance on the WM task, in which the MTBI group had a lower percentage
	of correct answers than the control group (p < 0.05). The patients
	with MTBI also had smaller amplitudes of both frontal N350 and parietal
	P300 ERP components when compared with control volunteers (p < 0.05).
	No changes were found for latency of ERP components. Smaller ERP
	amplitudes were associated with slower reaction times and worse accuracy
	on the WM task among patients with MTBI (p < 0.05). Types of injury
	(that is, sports concussion vs other mechanisms) were not associated
	with different ERP characteristics.Abnormal ERP results are observed
	in patients after MTBI or sports concussion, even for those in the
	nonacute stage after their injury. Current standard clinical evaluations
	most often fail to detect cerebral dysfunction after MTBI, even when
	patients or athletes report symptoms. Clinicians should be aware
	that patients with MTBI, including sports concussion, probably have
	underlying mild but persistent cerebral dysfunctions that require
	further investigation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuro-imaging studies demonstrate plasticity of cortical
	gray matter before and after practice for some motor and cognitive
	tasks in adults. Other imaging studies show functional changes after
	practice, but there is not yet direct evidence of how structural
	and functional changes may be related. A fundamental question is
	whether they occur at the same cortical sites, adjacent sites, or
	sites in other parts of a network. FINDINGS: Using a 3 T MRI, we
	obtained structural and functional images in adolescent girls before
	and after practice on a visual-spatial problem-solving computer game,
	Tetris. After three months of practice, compared to the structural
	scans of controls, the group with Tetris practice showed thicker
	cortex, primarily in two areas: left BAs 6 and 22/38. Based on fMRI
	BOLD signals, the Tetris group showed cortical activations throughout
	the brain while playing Tetris, but significant BOLD decreases, mostly
	in frontal areas, were observed after practice. None of these BOLD
	decreases, however, overlapped with the cortical thickness changes.
	CONCLUSION: Regional cortical thickness changes were observed after
	three months of Tetris practice. Over the same period, brain activity
	decreases were observed in several other areas. These data indicate
	that structural change in one brain area does not necessarily result
	in functional change in the same location, at least on the levels
	assessed with these MRI methods.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To improve the reliability, accuracy, and computational efficiency
	of tissue classification with multispectral sequences [T1, T2, and
	proton density (PD)], we developed an automated method for identifying
	training classes to be used in a discriminant function analysis.
	We compared it with a supervised operator-dependent method, evaluating
	its reliability and validity. We also developed a fuzzy (continuous)
	classification to correct for partial voluming. METHOD: Images were
	obtained on a 1.5 T GE Signa MR scanner using three pulse sequences
	that were co-registered. Training classes for the discriminant analysis
	were obtained in two ways. The operator-dependent method involved
	defining circular ROIs containing 5-15 voxels that represented "pure"
	samples of gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal
	fluid (CSF), using a total of 150-300 voxels for each tissue type.
	The automated method involved selecting a large number of samples
	of brain tissue with sufficiently low variance and randomly placed
	throughout the brain ("plugs"), partitioning these samples into GM,
	WM, and CSF, and minimizing the amount of variance within each partition
	of samples to optimize its "purity." The purity of the plug was estimated
	by calculating the variance of 8 voxels in all modalities (T1, T2,
	and PD). We also compared "sharp" (discrete) measurements (which
	classified tissue only as GM, WM, or CSF) and "fuzzy" (continuous)
	measurements (which corrected for partial voluming by weighting the
	classification based on the mixture of tissue types in each voxel).
	RESULTS: Reliability was compared for the operator-dependent and
	automated methods as well as for the fuzzy versus sharp classification.
	The automated sharp classifications consistently had the highest
	interrater and intrarater reliability. Validity was assessed in three
	ways: reproducibility of measurements when the same individuals were
	scanned on multiple occasions, sensitivity of the method to detecting
	changes associated with aging, and agreement between the automated
	segmentation values and those produced through expert manual segmentation.
	The sharp automated classification emerged as slightly superior to
	the other three methods according to each of these validators. Its
	reproducibility index (intraclass r) was 0.97, 0.98, and 0.98 for
	total CSF, total GM, and total WM, respectively. Its correlations
	with age were 0.54, -0.61, and -0.53, respectively. Its percent agreement
	with the expert manually segmented tissue for the three tissue types
	was 93, 90, and 94%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Automated identification
	of training classes for discriminant analysis was clearly superior
	to a method that required operator intervention. A sharp (discrete)
	classification into three tissue types was also slightly superior
	to one that used "fuzzy" classification to produce continuous measurements
	to correct for partial voluming. This multispectral automated discriminant
	analysis method produces a computationally efficient, reliable, and
	valid method for classifying brain tissue into GM, WM, and CSF. It
	corrects some of the problems with reliability and computational
	inefficiency previously observed for operator-dependent approaches
	to segmentation.},

  abstract = {Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) is an important medical
	concern for active sports and military personnel. Multiple mild injuries
	may exacerbate tissue damage resulting in cumulative brain injury
	and poor functional recovery. In the present study, we investigated
	the time course of brain vulnerability to rmTBI in a rat model of
	mild cortical controlled impact. An initial mild injury was followed
	by a second injury unilaterally at an interval of 1, 3, or 7 days.
	RmTBI animals were compared to single mTBI and sham treated animals.
	Neuropathology was assessed using multi-modal magnetic resonance
	imaging (MRI), followed by ex vivo tissue immunohistochemistry. Neurological
	and behavioral outcomes were evaluated in a subset of animals receiving
	rmTBI 3 days apart and shams. RmTBI 1 or 3 days apart but not 7 days
	apart revealed significantly exacerbated MRI-definable lesion volumes
	compared to single mTBI and shams. Increases in cortical tissue damage,
	extravascular iron and glial activation assessed by histology/immunohistochemistry
	correlated with in vivo MRI findings where shorter intervals (1 or
	3 days apart) resulted in greater tissue pathology. There were no
	neurological deficits associated with rmTBI 3 day animals. At 1 mo
	post-injury, animals with rmTBI 3 days apart showed reduced exploratory
	behaviors and subtle spatial learning memory impairments were observed.
	Collectively, our findings suggest that the mildly-impacted brain
	is more vulnerable to repetitive injury when delivered within 3 days
	following initial mTBI.},

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of sustained impairment
	in military and civilian populations. However, mild (and some moderate)
	TBI can be difficult to diagnose due to lack of obvious external
	injuries and because the injuries are often not visible on conventional
	acute MRI or CT. Injured brain tissues in TBI patients generate pathological
	low-frequency neuronal magnetic signal (delta waves 1-4 Hz) that
	can be measured and localized by magnetoencephalography (MEG). We
	hypothesize that abnormal MEG delta waves originate from gray matter
	neurons that experience de-afferentation due to axonal injury to
	the underlying white matter fiber tracts, which is manifested on
	diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as reduced fractional anisotropy.
	The present study used a neuroimaging approach integrating findings
	of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI),
	evaluating their utility in diagnosing mild TBI in 10 subjects in
	whom conventional CT and MRI showed no visible lesions in 9. The
	results show: (1) the integrated approach with MEG and DTI is more
	sensitive than conventional CT and MRI in detecting subtle neuronal
	injury in mild TBI; (2) MEG slow waves in mild TBI patients originate
	from cortical gray matter areas that experience de-afferentation
	due to axonal injuries in the white matter fibers with reduced fractional
	anisotropy; (3) findings from the integrated imaging approach are
	consistent with post-concussive symptoms; (4) in some cases, abnormal
	MEG delta waves were observed in subjects without obvious DTI abnormality,
	indicating that MEG may be more sensitive than DTI in diagnosing
	mild TBI.},

  abstract = {The technique of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI), using various
	cognitive, motor and sensory stimuli has led to a revolution in the

	to elicit an hemodynamic change. Stimulation with a pharmaceutical
	has a number of very different consequences compared to user controllable
	stimuli, most importantly in the time course of stimulus and response
	that is not, in general, controllable by the experimenter. Therefore,
	this type of experiment has been termed pharmacologic MRI (phMRI).
	The use of a drug stimulus leads to a number of interesting possibilities
	compared to conventional fMRI. Using receptor specific ligands one
	can characterize brain circuitry specific to neurotransmitter systems.
	The possibility exists to measure parameters reflecting neurotransmitter
	release and binding associated with the pharmacokinetics and/or the
	pharmacodynamics of drugs. There is also the ability to measure up-
	and down-regulation of receptors in specific disease states. phMRI
	can be characterized as a molecular imaging technique using the natural
	hemodynamic transduction related to neuro-receptor stimulus. This
	provides a coupling mechanism with very high sensitivity that can
	rival positron emission tomography (PET) in some circumstances. The
	large numbers of molecules available, that do not require a radio-label,
	means that phMRI becomes a very useful tool for performing drug discovery.
	Data and arguments will be presented to show that phMRI can provide
	information on neuro-receptor signaling and function that complements

	thickness. The normal cortex varies in thickness from 2 to 4 mm,
	reflecting the morphology of neuronal sublayers. Cortical pathologies
	often manifest abnormal variations in thickness, with examples of
	Alzheimer's disease and cortical dysplasia as thin and thick cortex,
	respectively. Radiologically, images are 2-D slices through a highly
	convoluted 3-D object. Depending on the relative orientation of the
	slices with respect to the object, it is impossible to deduce abnormal
	cortical thickness without additional information from neighboring
	slices. We approach the problem by applying Laplace's Equation (V2psi
	= 0) from mathematical physics. The volume of the cortex is represented
	as the domain for the solution of the differential equation, with
	separate boundary conditions at the gray-white junction and the gray-CSF
	junction. Normalized gradients of psi form a vector field, representing
	tangent vectors along field lines connecting both boundaries. We
	define the cortical thickness at any point in the cortex to be the
	pathlength along such lines. Key advantages of this method are that
	it is fully three-dimensional, and the thickness is uniquely defined
	for any point in the cortex. We present graphical results that map
	cortical thickness everywhere in a normal brain. Results show global
	variations in cortical thickness consistent with known neuroanatomy.
	The application of this technique to visualization of cortical thickness
	in brains with known pathology has broad clinical implications.},

	with mild TBI had a significantly higher number of potholes than
	those without TBI. The difference in the number of potholes was not
	influenced by age, time since trauma, a history of mild TBI unrelated
	to deployment, or coexisting psychopathology. The number of potholes
	was correlated with the severity of TBI and with performance in executive
	functioning tasks.Veterans who had blast-related mild TBI showed
	evidence of multifocal white matter abnormalities that were associated

  abstract = {Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder
	diagnosed on the basis of motor symptoms, but that also includes
	cognitive and visuo-spatial deficits. Though PD is known to initially
	affect subcortical regions, the cortex also exhibits neuronal loss
	in the course of the disease as post mortem studies have shown. So
	far, PD-related pattern of cortical damage remains unclear, because
	of disease-caused heterogeneity, and also in part because of methodological
	issues such as the limitations of Voxel Based Morphometry. Here corticometry
	was used, a technique that decouples local surface from thickness,
	to obtain a better picture of PD corticomorphometric patterns. We
	acquired MRI volumes for 33 healthy controls (HC) and 49 PD patients,
	extracted local cortical thickness and surface area and modeled both
	of them as a function of group and age for each participant. Cortical
	thickness averaged on the whole cortex did not differ between the
	two groups while mean surface area was significantly larger in the
	PD group. The bilateral parietal lobule, the right superior frontal
	gyrus, the left cingulate cortex and the left insular cortex exhibited
	larger local surface area in the PD group. The right precuneus exhibited
	cortical thinning associated with age in the PD group and not in
	the HC group. Furthermore, cortical thinning was observed in the
	PD group compared with the control group in the left medial supplementary
	motor area (SMA) and in the right dorsal pre-SMA. Finally, we found
	the left temporal pole thickness to correlate with disease duration,
	as well as the bilateral occipital cortex and Broca's area. These
	results suggest that PD etiology is associated with specific cortical
	alterations, which could account for cognitive deficits that arise
	as the disease evolves. Finally, our results observed in the occipital
	cortex as a function of disease duration may indicate the increase
	in PD-related visuo-spatial deficits, which can sometimes result
	in hallucinations later on in the disease. In the future, MRI-generated
	corticometry, combined with additional behavioral markers, may prove
	to be a useful diagnosis tool to characterize the evolution of motor
	and cognitive deficits in PD.},

	be related to drug-taking behavior that prevails in smokers. Cortical
	thickness has been found to be a structural modulator of cerebral
	function and cognition and a subtle correlate of mental disorders.
	However, to date an analysis of cortical thickness in smokers compared
	with never-smokers has not been undertaken. METHODS: We acquired
	high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging scans from 22 smokers
	and 21 never-smokers and used FreeSurfer to model the gray-white
	and pial surfaces for each individual cortex to compute the distance
	between these surfaces to obtain a measure of cortical thickness.
	The main cortical folds were aligned across individuals with FreeSurfer's
	surface-based averaging technique to compare whole brain differences
	in cortical thickness between smokers and never-smokers. RESULTS:
	Relative to never-smokers, smokers showed greater cortical thinning
	in the left medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC). Cortical thickness
	measures extracted from mOFC correlated negatively with the amount
	of cigarettes consumed/day and the magnitude of lifetime exposure
	to tobacco smoke. CONCLUSIONS: The brains of smokers are structurally
	different from those of never-smokers in a dose-dependent manner.
	The cortical thinning in mOFC in smokers relative to never-smokers
	might imply dysfunctions of the brain's reward, impulse control,
	and decision-making circuits. Related behavioral correlates are suggested
	to be relevant for smoking initiation and maintenance.},

  abstract = {A validation study was conducted to assess the accuracy of the algorithm
	developed by MacDonald et al. (1999) for measuring cortical thickness.
	This algorithm automatically determines the cortical thickness by
	3-D extraction of the inner and outer surfaces of the cerebral cortex
	from an MRI scan. A manual method of tagging the grey-csf and grey-white
	interface was used on 20 regions (10 cortical areas found in each
	hemisphere) in 40 MRIs of the brain to validate the algorithm. The
	regions were chosen throughout the cortex to get broad assessment
	of the algorithm's performance. Accuracy was determined by an anatomist
	tagging the csf-grey and grey-white borders of selected gyri and
	by allowing the algorithm to determine the csf-grey and grey-white
	borders and the corresponding cortical thickness of the same region.
	Results from the manual and automatic methods were statistically
	compared using overall ANOVA and paired t tests for each region.
	The manual and automatic methods were in agreement for all but 4
	of the 20 regions tested. The four regions where there were significant
	differences between the two methods were the insula left and right,
	the right cuneus, and the right parahippocampus. We conclude that
	the automatic algorithm is valid for most of the cortex and provides
	a viable alternative to manual methods of determining cortical thickness
	in vivo. However, caution should be taken when measuring the regions
	mentioned previously where the results of the algorithm can be biased
	by surrounding grey structures.},

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most common causes of long-term
	disability. Despite the importance of identifying neuropathology
	in individuals with chronic TBI, methodological challenges posed
	at the stage of inter-subject image registration have hampered previous
	voxel-based MRI studies from providing a clear pattern of structural
	atrophy after TBI. We used a novel symmetric diffeomorphic image
	normalization method to conduct a tensor-based morphometry (TBM)
	study of TBI. The key advantage of this method is that it simultaneously
	estimates an optimal template brain and topology preserving deformations
	between this template and individual subject brains. Detailed patterns
	of atrophies are then revealed by statistically contrasting control
	and subject deformations to the template space. Participants were
	29 survivors of TBI and 20 control subjects who were matched in terms
	of age, gender, education, and ethnicity. Localized volume losses
	were found most prominently in white matter regions and the subcortical
	nuclei including the thalamus, the midbrain, the corpus callosum,
	the mid- and posterior cingulate cortices, and the caudate. Significant
	voxel-wise volume loss clusters were also detected in the cerebellum
	and the frontal/temporal neocortices. Volume enlargements were identified
	largely in ventricular regions. A similar pattern of results was
	observed in a subgroup analysis where we restricted our analysis
	to the 17 TBI participants who had no macroscopic focal lesions (total
	lesion volume >1.5 cm(3)). The current study confirms, extends, and
	partly challenges previous structural MRI studies in chronic TBI.
	By demonstrating that a large deformation image registration technique
	can be successfully combined with TBM to identify TBI-induced diffuse
	structural changes with greater precision, our approach is expected
	to increase the sensitivity of future studies examining brain-behavior
	relationships in the TBI population.},

  abstract = {Non-invasive measurement of resting state cerebral blood flow (CBF)
	may reflect alterations of brain structure and function after traumatic
	brain injury (TBI). However, previous imaging studies of resting
	state brain in chronic TBI have been limited by several factors,
	including measurement in relative rather than absolute units, use
	of crude spatial registration methods, exclusion of subjects with
	substantial focal lesions, and exposure to ionizing radiation, which
	limits repeated assessments. This study aimed to overcome those obstacles
	by measuring absolute CBF with an arterial spin labeling perfusion
	fMRI technique, and using an image preprocessing protocol that is
	optimized for brains with mixed diffuse and focal injuries characteristic
	of moderate and severe TBI. Resting state CBF was quantified in 27
	individuals with moderate to severe TBI in the chronic stage, and
	22 demographically matched healthy controls. In addition to global
	CBF reductions in the TBI subjects, more prominent regional hypoperfusion
	was found in the posterior cingulate cortices, the thalami, and multiple
	locations in the frontal cortices. Diffuse injury, as assessed by
	tensor-based morphometry, was mainly associated with reduced CBF
	in the posterior cingulate cortices and the thalami, where the greatest
	volume losses were detected. Hypoperfusion in superior and middle
	frontal cortices, in contrast, was associated with focal lesions.
	These results suggest that structural lesions, both focal and diffuse,
	are the main contributors to the absolute CBF alterations seen in
	chronic TBI, and that CBF may serve as a tool to assess functioning
	neuronal volume. We also speculate that resting reductions in posterior
	cingulate perfusion may reflect alterations in the default-mode network,
	and may contribute to the attentional deficits common in TBI.},

  abstract = {Accurate reconstruction of the inner and outer cortical surfaces of
	the human cerebrum is a critical objective for a wide variety of
	neuroimaging analysis purposes, including visualization, morphometry,
	and brain mapping. The Anatomic Segmentation using Proximity (ASP)
	algorithm, previously developed by our group, provides a topology-preserving
	cortical surface deformation method that has been extensively used
	for the aforementioned purposes. However, constraints in the algorithm
	to ensure topology preservation occasionally produce incorrect thickness
	measurements due to a restriction in the range of allowable distances
	between the gray and white matter surfaces. This problem is particularly
	prominent in pediatric brain images with tightly folded gyri. This
	paper presents a novel method for improving the conventional ASP
	algorithm by making use of partial volume information through probabilistic
	classification in order to allow for topology preservation across
	a less restricted range of cortical thickness values. The new algorithm
	also corrects the classification of the insular cortex by masking
	out subcortical tissues. For 70 pediatric brains, validation experiments
	for the modified algorithm, Constrained Laplacian ASP (CLASP), were
	performed by three methods: (i) volume matching between surface-masked
	gray matter (GM) and conventional tissue-classified GM, (ii) surface
	matching between simulated and CLASP-extracted surfaces, and (iii)
	repeatability of the surface reconstruction among 16 MRI scans of
	the same subject. In the volume-based evaluation, the volume enclosed
	by the CLASP WM and GM surfaces matched the classified GM volume
	13% more accurately than using conventional ASP. In the surface-based
	evaluation, using synthesized thick cortex, the average difference
	between simulated and extracted surfaces was 4.6 +/- 1.4 mm for conventional
	ASP and 0.5 +/- 0.4 mm for CLASP. In a repeatability study, CLASP
	produced a 30% lower RMS error for the GM surface and a 8% lower
	RMS error for the WM surface compared with ASP.},

  abstract = {All fields of neuroscience that employ brain imaging need to communicate
	their results with reference to anatomical regions. In particular,
	comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological
	data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences
	across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration
	of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures,
	so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains
	to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear
	deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted.
	Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated
	using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations
	between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including:
	AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO,
	SICLE, SyN, and four different SPM5 algorithms ("SPM2-type" and regular
	Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the DARTEL Toolbox). All
	of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between
	the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings
	of this study is that the relative performances of the registration
	methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice
	of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure.
	This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable
	to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different
	labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according
	to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way
	ANOVA tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost
	identical top rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK, and SPM's
	DARTEL Toolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance
	measures, with ART and SyN delivering the most consistently high
	accuracy across subjects and label sets. Updates will be published
	on the http://www.mindboggle.info/papers/ website.},

	healthy human subjects (aged 11-90 years). Whole-brain FA and GM
	thickness values followed quadratic trajectories with age but the
	relationship between them was linear, indicating that a putative
	biological mechanism may explain the non-linearity of their age trajectories.
	Inclusion of the FA values into the quadratic model of the whole-brain
	and regional GM thickness changes with age made the effect of the
	age(2) term no longer significant for the whole-brain GM thickness
	and greatly reduced its significance for regional GM thickness measurements.
	The phylogenetic order of cerebral myelination helped to further
	explain the intersubject variability in GM thickness. FA values for
	the early maturing WM were significantly better (p=10(-6)) at explaining
	variability in GM thickness in maturing (aged 11-20) subjects than
	FA values for the late maturing WM. The opposite trend was observed
	for aging subjects (aged 40-90) where FA values for the late maturing
	WM were better (p=10(-16)) at explaining the variability in GM thickness.
	We concluded that the non-linearity of the age trajectory for GM
	thickness, measured from T1-weighted MRI, was partially explained
	by the heterogeneity and the heterochronicity of the age-related
	changes in the microintegrity of cerebral WM. We consider these findings

	subjects using cortical surface-based analysis. METHODS: Brain magnetic
	resonance images were acquired from 25 subjects with bipolar disorder
	and 21 healthy comparison subjects. Cortical surface-based analysis
	was conducted using the Freesurfer application. Group differences
	in cortical thickness, defined by the distance from gray/white boundary
	to the pial surface, were assessed using statistical difference maps.
	RESULTS: Subjects with bipolar disorder exhibited significantly decreased
	cortical thickness in left cingulate cortex, left middle frontal
	cortex, left middle occipital cortex, right medial frontal cortex,
	right angular cortex, right fusiform cortex and bilateral postcentral
	cortices, relative to healthy comparison subjects (all p < 0.001).
	Duration of illness in bipolar subjects was inversely correlated
	with the cortical thickness of the left middle frontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS:
	Cortical thinning was present in multiple prefrontal cortices in
	bipolar disorder. There was also cortical thinning in sensory and
	sensory association cortices, which has not been reported in previous
	studies using region-of-interest or voxel-based morphometry methods.
	Cortical thinning observed in the current study may be related to
	impairment of emotional, cognitive, and sensory processing in bipolar
	disorder but longitudinal studies will be necessary to test this

	were 63 U.S. military personnel who had a clinical diagnosis of mild,
	uncomplicated traumatic brain injury. They were evacuated from the
	field to the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Landstuhl, Germany,
	where they underwent DTI scanning within 90 days after the injury.
	All the subjects had primary blast exposure plus another, blast-related
	mechanism of injury (e.g., being struck by a blunt object or injured
	in a fall or motor vehicle crash). Controls consisted of 21 military
	personnel who had blast exposure and other injuries but no clinical
	diagnosis of traumatic brain injury.Abnormalities revealed on DTI
	were consistent with traumatic axonal injury in many of the subjects
	with traumatic brain injury. None had detectable intracranial injury
	on computed tomography. As compared with DTI scans in controls, the
	scans in the subjects with traumatic brain injury showed marked abnormalities
	in the middle cerebellar peduncles (P<0.001), in cingulum bundles
	(P=0.002), and in the right orbitofrontal white matter (P=0.007).
	In 18 of the 63 subjects with traumatic brain injury, a significantly
	greater number of abnormalities were found on DTI than would be expected
	by chance (P<0.001). Follow-up DTI scans in 47 subjects with traumatic
	brain injury 6 to 12 months after enrollment showed persistent abnormalities
	that were consistent with evolving injuries.DTI findings in U.S.
	military personnel support the hypothesis that blast-related mild
	traumatic brain injury can involve axonal injury. However, the contribution
	of primary blast exposure as compared with that of other types of
	injury could not be determined directly, since none of the subjects
	with traumatic brain injury had isolated primary blast injury. Furthermore,
	many of these subjects did not have abnormalities on DTI. Thus, traumatic
	brain injury remains a clinical diagnosis. (Funded by the Congressionally

	as those produced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is greatly
	aided by deformable models, which are used to extract, identify,
	and quantify specific neuroanatomic structures. A general method
	of deforming polyhedra is presented here, with two novel features.
	First, explicit prevention of self-intersecting surface geometries
	is provided, unlike conventional deformable models, which use regularization
	constraints to discourage but not necessarily prevent such behavior.
	Second, deformation of multiple surfaces with intersurface proximity
	constraints allows each surface to help guide other surfaces into
	place using model-based constraints such as expected thickness of
	an anatomic surface. These two features are used advantageously to
	identify automatically the total surface of the outer and inner boundaries
	of cerebral cortical gray matter from normal human MR images, accurately
	locating the depths of the sulci, even where noise and partial volume
	artifacts in the image obscure the visibility of sulci. The extracted
	surfaces are enforced to be simple two-dimensional manifolds (having
	the topology of a sphere), even though the data may have topological
	holes. This automatic 3-D cortex segmentation technique has been
	applied to 150 normal subjects, simultaneously extracting both the
	gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid interface from each individual.
	The collection of surfaces has been used to create a spatial map
	of the mean and standard deviation for the location and the thickness
	of cortical gray matter. Three alternative criteria for defining
	cortical thickness at each cortical location were developed and compared.
	These results are shown to corroborate published postmortem and in
	vivo measurements of cortical thickness.},

	sulci become more flattened and less curved. Cortical thickness also
	decreases over time. Cortical thinning progresses more rapidly in

	the timing and spatial location of human brain activity. Brain and
	behavioural responses to pain are influenced by multiple intrinsic
	and extrinsic factors and display considerable, natural trial-by-trial
	variability. However, because the neuronal sources of this variability
	are poorly understood the functional information it contains is under-exploited
	for understanding the relationship between brain function and behaviour.
	We recorded simultaneous EEG-fMRI during rest and noxious thermal
	stimulation to characterise the relationship between natural fluctuations
	in behavioural pain-ratings, the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain
	network responses and intrinsic connectivity. We demonstrate that
	fMRI response variability in the pain network is: dependent upon
	its resting-state functional connectivity; modulated by behaviour;
	and correlated with EEG evoked-potential amplitude. The pre-stimulus
	default-mode network (DMN) fMRI signal predicts the subsequent magnitude
	of pain ratings, evoked-potentials and pain network BOLD responses.
	Additionally, the power of the ongoing EEG alpha oscillation, an
	index of cortical excitability, modulates the DMN fMRI response to
	pain. The complex interaction between alpha-power, DMN activity and
	both the behavioural report of pain and the brain's response to pain
	demonstrates the neurobiological significance of trial-by-trial variability.
	Furthermore, we show that multiple, interconnected factors contribute
	to both the brain's response to stimulation and the psychophysiological
	emergence of the subjective experience of pain.},

	(tt) and ?-amyloid (A?(1-42)) ratio (tt/A?) in patients with AD and
	patients with FTLD. We then evaluated accuracy of MRI-based predicted
	tt/A? using 4 converging sources including neuroanatomic visualization
	and categorization of a subset of patients with genetic or autopsy-confirmed
	AD or FTLD.Regression analyses showed that MRI-predicted tt/A? is
	highly related to actual CSF tt/A?. In each group, both predicted
	and actual CSF tt/A? have extensively overlapping neuroanatomic correlates:
	low tt/A? consistent with FTLD is related to ventromedial prefrontal
	regions while high tt/A? consistent with AD is related to posterior
	cortical regions. MRI-predicted tt/A? is 75\% accurate at identifying

	possible associations between mild TBI and addiction-related disorders
	in active-duty U.S. military personnel.A historical prospective study
	was conducted using electronically recorded demographic, medical,
	and military data for more than a half million active-duty U.S. Air
	Force service members. Cases were identified by ICD-9-CM codes considered
	by an expert panel to be indicative of mild TBI. Outcomes included
	ICD-9-CM diagnoses of selected addiction-related disorders. Cox proportional
	hazards modeling was used to calculate hazard ratios while controlling
	for varying lengths of follow-up and potential confounding variables.Airmen
	with mild TBI were at increased risk for certain addiction-related
	disorders compared with a similarly injured non-mild TBI comparison
	group. Hazards for alcohol dependence, nicotine dependence, and nondependent
	abuse of drugs or alcohol were significantly elevated, with a consistent
	decrease over time.A novel finding of this study was the initial
	increased risk for addiction-related disorders that decreased with
	time, thus eroding war fighter performance in a military population.
	Moreover, these results suggest that mild TBI is distinguished from
	moderate to severe TBI in terms of timing of the risk, indicating
	that there is a need for screening and prevention of addiction-related
	disorders in mild TBI. Screening may be warranted in military troops

  abstract = {Recent military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have highlighted
	the wartime effect of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The reason for
	the prominence of TBI in these particular conflicts as opposed to

	of blast due to improvements in body armor. In the military context
	blunt, ballistic and blast effects may all contribute to CNS injury,
	however blast in particular, has been suggested as a primary cause
	of military TBI. While blast effects on some biological tissues,
	such as the lung, are documented in terms of injury thresholds, this
	is not the case for the CNS. We hypothesized that using bio-fidelic
	models, allowing for fluid-solid interaction and basic material properties
	available in the literature, a blast wave would interact with CNS
	tissue and cause a possible concussive effect.The modeling approach
	employed for this investigation consisted of a computational framework
	suitable for simulating coupled fluid-solid dynamic interactions.
	The model included a complex finite element mesh of the head and
	intra-cranial contents. The effects of threshold and 50\% lethal
	blast lung injury were compared with concussive impact injury using
	the full head model allowing upper and lower bounds of tissue injury
	to be applied using pulmonary injury as the reference tissue.The
	effects of a 50\% lethal dose blast lung injury (LD(50)) were comparable
	with concussive impact injury using the DVBIC-MIT full head model.CNS
	blast concussive effects were found to be similar between impact
	mild TBI and the blast field associated with LD(50) lung blast injury
	sustained without personal protective equipment. With the ubiquitous
	use of personal protective equipment this suggests that blast concussive
	effects may more readily ascertained in personnel due to enhanced

  abstract = {Mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common source of morbidity
	from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. With no overt lesions on structural
	MRI, diagnosis of chronic mild TBI in military veterans relies on
	obtaining an accurate history and assessment of behavioral symptoms
	that are also associated with frequent comorbid disorders, particularly
	posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Military veterans
	from Iraq and Afghanistan with mild TBI (n = 30) with comorbid PTSD
	and depression and non-TBI participants from primary (n = 42) and
	confirmatory (n = 28) control groups were assessed with high angular
	resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). White matter-specific registration
	followed by whole-brain voxelwise analysis of crossing fibers provided
	separate partial volume fractions reflecting the integrity of primary
	fibers and secondary (crossing) fibers. Loss of white matter integrity
	in primary fibers (P < 0.05; corrected) was associated with chronic
	mild TBI in a widely distributed pattern of major fiber bundles and
	smaller peripheral tracts including the corpus callosum (genu, body,
	and splenium), forceps minor, forceps major, superior and posterior
	corona radiata, internal capsule, superior longitudinal fasciculus,
	and others. Distributed loss of white matter integrity correlated
	with duration of loss of consciousness and most notably with "feeling
	dazed or confused," but not diagnosis of PTSD or depressive symptoms.
	This widespread spatial extent of white matter damage has typically
	been reported in moderate to severe TBI. The diffuse loss of white
	matter integrity appears consistent with systemic mechanisms of damage

	are significantly impaired in their comprehension of logical quantifiers
	(e.g. "Some of the birds are on the branch"), associated with a simple
	form of perceptual logic, and this correlated with their deficit

	their deficit on executive measures. This was related to disease
	in the basal ganglia interrupting a frontal-striatal loop critical

	of our study was to determine the presence of sleep disorders in
	U.S. Military Personnel referred for evaluation of sleep disturbances
	after deployment and examine associations between sleep disorders
	and service-related diagnoses of depression, mild traumatic brain
	injury (TBI), pain and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS:
	Cross-sectional study of military personnel with sleep disturbances
	who returned from combat within 18 months. Sleep disorder rendered
	by clinical evaluation and polysomnogram with validated instruments
	to diagnose service-related illnesses. RESULTS: Of 110 military personnel
	included in our analysis, 97.3\% were male (mean age 33.6 ± 8.0 years;
	mean BMI of 30.0 ± 4.3) and 70.9\% returned from combat within 12
	months. Nearly half, 47.3\% met diagnostic criteria for 2 or more
	service-related diagnoses. Sleep disorders were diagnosed in 88.2\%
	and 11.8\% had a normal sleep evaluation and served as controls.
	Overall, 62.7\% met diagnostic criteria for obstructive sleep apnea
	(OSA) and 63.6\% for insomnia. The exclusive diagnoses of insomnia
	and OSA were present in 25.5\% and 24.5\% respectively; 38.2\% had
	comorbid insomnia and OSA. Military personnel with comorbid insomnia
	and OSA were significantly more likely to meet criteria for depression
	(p \&lt;0.01) and PTSD (p\&lt;0.01) compared to controls and those
	with OSA. CONCLUSIONS: Comorbid insomnia and OSA is a frequent diagnosis
	in military personnel referred for evaluation of sleep disturbances
	after deployment. This diagnosis, which is difficult to treat, may
	explain the refractory nature of many service-related diagnoses.},

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects both white matter and gray matter
	(GM). Measurement of GM volumes is a particularly useful method to
	estimate the total extent of GM tissue damage because it can be done
	with conventional magnetic resonance images (MRI). Many algorithms
	exist for segmentation of GM, but none were specifically designed
	to handle issues associated with MS, such as atrophy and the effects
	that MS lesions may have on the classification of GM. A new GM segmentation
	algorithm has been developed specifically for calculation of GM volumes
	in MS patients. The new algorithm uses a combination of intensity,
	anatomical, and morphological probability maps. Several validation
	tests were performed to evaluate the algorithm in terms of accuracy,
	reproducibility, and sensitivity to MS lesions. The accuracy tests
	resulted in error rates of 1.2% and 3.1% for comparisons to BrainWeb
	and manual tracings, respectively. Similarity indices indicated excellent
	agreement with the BrainWeb segmentation (0.858-0.975, for various
	levels of noise and rf inhomogeneity). The scan-rescan reproducibility
	test resulted in a mean coefficient of variation of 1.1% for GM fraction.
	Tests of the effects of varying the size of MS lesions revealed a
	moderate and consistent dependence of GM volumes on T2 lesion volume,
	which suggests that GM volumes should be corrected for T2 lesion
	volumes using a simple scale factor in order to eliminate this technical
	artifact. The new segmentation algorithm can be used for improved
	measurement of GM volumes in MS patients, and is particularly applicable
	to retrospective datasets.},

  abstract = {Measurement of changes in brain cortical thickness is useful for the
	assessment of regional gray matter atrophy in neurodegenerative conditions.
	A new longitudinal method, called CLADA (cortical longitudinal atrophy
	detection algorithm), has been developed for the measurement of changes
	in cortical thickness in magnetic resonance images (MRI) acquired
	over time. CLADA creates a subject-specific cortical model which
	is longitudinally deformed to match images from individual time points.
	The algorithm was designed to work reliably for lower resolution
	images, such as the MRIs with 1Ã1Ã5 mm(3) voxels previously acquired
	for many clinical trials in multiple sclerosis (MS). CLADA was evaluated
	to determine reproducibility, accuracy, and sensitivity. Scan-rescan
	variability was 0.45% for images with 1mm(3) isotropic voxels and
	0.77% for images with 1Ã1Ã5 mm(3) voxels. The mean absolute accuracy
	error was 0.43 mm, as determined by comparison of CLADA measurements
	to cortical thickness measured directly in post-mortem tissue. CLADA's
	sensitivity for correctly detecting at least 0.1mm change was 86%
	in a simulation study. A comparison to FreeSurfer showed good agreement
	(Pearson correlation=0.73 for global mean thickness). CLADA was also
	applied to MRIs acquired over 18 months in secondary progressive
	MS patients who were imaged at two different resolutions. Cortical
	thinning was detected in this group in both the lower and higher
	resolution images. CLADA detected a higher rate of cortical thinning
	in MS patients compared to healthy controls over 2 years. These results
	show that CLADA can be used for reliable measurement of cortical
	atrophy in longitudinal studies, even in lower resolution images.},

	differences in regional cortical thickness between 96 patients with
	a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia (n=81) or schizoaffective disorder
	(n=15) and 107 healthy subjects (mean age 42 years, range 17-57 years)
	were investigated using MRI and computer image analysis. Cortical
	thickness was estimated as the shortest distance between the gray/white
	matter border and the pial surface at numerous points across the
	entire cortical mantle. The influence of age and antipsychotic medication
	on variation in global and regional cortical thickness was explored.
	Thinner cortex among patients than controls was found in prefrontal
	and temporal regions of both hemispheres, while parietal and occipital
	regions were relatively spared. Some hemispheric specificity was
	noted, as regions of the prefrontal cortex were more affected in
	the right hemisphere, and regions of the temporal cortex in the left
	hemisphere. No significant interaction effect of age and diagnostic
	group on variation in cortical thickness was demonstrated. Among
	patients, dose or type of antipsychotic medication did not affect
	variation in cortical thickness. The results from this hitherto largest
	study on the topic show that prefrontal and temporal cortical thinning
	in patients with schizophrenia compared to controls is as pronounced
	in older as in younger subjects. The lack of significant influence
	from antipsychotic medication supports that regional cortical thinning

	within a probabilistic framework that examines both label geometry
	and appearance data at each label. We evaluate the reliability of
	this framework with respect to manual labeling and show that it increases
	minimum performance levels relative to fully automated approaches

  abstract = {Registration of diffusion-weighted images is an important step in
	comparing white matter fibre bundles across subjects, or in the same
	subject at different time points. Using diffusion-weighted imaging,
	Spherical Deconvolution enables multiple fibre populations within
	a voxel to be resolved by computing the fibre orientation distribution
	(FOD). In this paper, we present a novel method that employs FODs
	for the registration of diffusion-weighted images. Registration was
	performed by optimising a symmetric diffeomorphic non-linear transformation
	model, using image metrics based on the mean squared difference,
	and cross-correlation of the FOD spherical harmonic coefficients.
	The proposed method was validated by recovering known displacement
	fields using FODs represented with maximum harmonic degrees (l(max))
	of 2, 4 and 6. Results demonstrate a benefit in using FODs at l(max)=4
	compared to l(max)=2. However, a decrease in registration accuracy
	was observed when l(max)=6 was used; this was likely caused by noise
	in higher harmonic degrees. We compared our proposed method to fractional
	anisotropy driven registration using an identical code base and parameters.
	FOD registration was observed to perform significantly better than
	FA in all experiments. The cross-correlation metric performed significantly
	better than the mean squared difference. Finally, we demonstrated
	the utility of this method by computing an unbiased group average
	FOD template that was used for probabilistic fibre tractography.
	This work suggests that using crossing fibre information aids in
	the alignment of white matter and could therefore benefit several
	methods for investigating population differences in white matter,
	including voxel based analysis, tensor based morphometry, atlas based
	segmentation and labelling, and group average fibre tractography.},

	forms of offending. This study tests the hypothesis that white-collar
	criminals have better executive functioning, enhanced information
	processing, and structural brain superiorities compared with offender
	controls. Using a case-control design, executive functioning, orienting,
	and cortical thickness was assessed in 21 white-collar criminals
	matched with 21 controls on age, gender, ethnicity, and general level
	of criminal offending. White-collar criminals had significantly better
	executive functioning, increased electrodermal orienting, increased
	arousal, and increased cortical gray matter thickness in the ventromedial
	prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, somatosensory cortex,
	and the temporal-parietal junction compared with controls. Results,
	while initial, constitute the first findings on neurobiological characteristics
	of white-collar criminals. It is hypothesized that white-collar criminals
	have information-processing and brain superiorities that give them
	an advantage in perpetrating criminal offenses in occupational settings.

	problems including diabetes, hypertension, and stroke. These cardiovascular
	afflictions increase risk for cognitive decline and dementia, but

	We used tensor-based morphometry (TBM) to examine gray matter (GM)

	remained cognitively normal for at least 5 years after their scan.
	Bivariate analyses with corrections for multiple comparisons strongly

	and Type II Diabetes Mellitus (DM2) with atrophy in frontal, temporal,
	and subcortical brain regions. A multiple regression model, also
	correcting for multiple comparisons, revealed that BMI was still
	negatively correlated with brain atrophy (FDR <5%), while DM2 and
	FPI were no longer associated with any volume differences. In an
	Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model controlling for age, gender,
	and race, obese subjects with a high BMI (BMI > 30) showed atrophy
	in the frontal lobes, anterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, and
	thalamus compared with individuals with a normal BMI (18.5-25). Overweight
	subjects (BMI: 25-30) had atrophy in the basal ganglia and corona
	radiata of the WM. Overall brain volume did not differ between overweight

	exposure affects longitudinal neurocognitive development of the human

	adolescents with non-cocaine-exposed control subjects.Twenty-four
	cocaine-exposed adolescents and 25 matched non-cocaine-exposed control
	subjects underwent structural and perfusion functional MRI during
	resting states. Direct subtraction, voxel-wise general linear modeling,
	and region-of-interest analyses were performed on the cerebral blood
	flow images to compare the resting cerebral blood flow between the
	2 groups.Compared with control subjects, cocaine-exposed adolescents
	showed significantly reduced global cerebral blood flow. The decrease
	of cerebral blood flow in cocaine-exposed adolescents was observed
	mainly in posterior and inferior brain regions, including the occipital
	cortex and thalamus. After adjusting for global cerebral blood flow,
	however, a significant increase in relative cerebral blood flow in
	cocaine-exposed adolescents was found in anterior and superior brain
	regions, including the prefrontal, cingulate, insular, amygdala,
	and superior parietal cortex. Furthermore, the functional modulations
	by in utero cocaine exposure on all of these regions except amygdala
	cannot be accounted for by the variation in brain anatomy.In utero
	cocaine exposure may reduce global cerebral blood flow, and this
	reduction may persist into adolescence. The relative increase of
	cerebral blood flow in anterior and superior brain regions in cocaine-exposed
	adolescent participants suggests that compensatory mechanisms for
	reduced global cerebral blood flow may develop during neural ontogeny.

	We address the question, what are the implications of this revision

	logical structures for neuropsychiatric disorders was reviewed. The
	symptom pattern of TBI was identified, and a literature survey determined
	the frequency of these symptom patterns in other disorders and in

	frequencies in populations with a history of mild TBI. In some studies,
	the frequency of symptom endorsement in healthy controls having no
	history of head injury actually exceeded the endorsement rates in
	a comparison group with a history mild TBI.The heterogeneity of this
	clinical population and their clinical presentations, the absence
	of a unitary etiology of postinjury deficits, and the complex idiosyncratic
	time course of the appearance of these deficits argue against the
	valid implementation of the classical model of diagnosis. In addition,

	a new algorithm, Nonparametric Local Smoothing (NLS) for image registration,

	although these measures do not relate reliably to the realism of
	the correspondence map.Using data obtained from its authors, we show

	it does not compute accurate, interpretable transformations. Even
	judged by image similarity alone, the proposed method is consistently
	outperformed by a simple pixel permutation algorithm, which is known
	by design not to compute valid registrations.This study has demonstrated
	that the NLS algorithm proposed recently for image registration,
	and published in one of the most respected journals in computer science,
	is not, in fact, an effective registration method at all. Our results
	also emphasize the general need to apply registration evaluation
	criteria that are sensitive to whether correspondences are accurate

  abstract = {Substantial changes in brain morphology mark the course of alcoholism
	from development through dependence, recovery, and relapse. These
	changes can be characterized with deformation-based morphometry,
	which quantifies shape differences between anatomical structures,
	either in different subjects (cross-sectional) or in the same subject
	over time (longitudinal). Here we present analyses of data from a
	longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study on the effects
	of alcoholism on brain structure. Images were acquired from alcoholic
	women (n=7, mean age 47.8+/-8.3 years) and age-matched control women
	(n=16, mean age 51.2+/-7.5 years). From each subject, we acquired
	two structural MR brain images, separated by approximately 2 years
	(mean 21.6+/-7 months). We performed two types of morphometry using
	log-Jacobian maps of inter-subject and intra-subject nonrigid coordinate
	transformations, justified by the invariance of relevant statistics
	(mean, standard deviation, z-score, and t-test) under changes of
	the spatial and temporal reference coordinate system. With all images
	from one time point, a cross-sectional inter-subject morphometry
	determined group differences between alcoholics and normal controls.
	We compared these results with longitudinal intra-subject morphometry
	based on two images per subject acquired at different times (approximately
	2 years apart). Inter- and intra-subject analysis produced partially
	conflicting results. Whereas the intra-subject analysis indicated
	faster ventricular volume increases in the alcoholics (+11\% per
	year) than in the controls (+2\% per year), the inter-subject analysis
	showed, on average, smaller absolute ventricle volumes in the alcoholics
	than in the controls (-33\% relative volume). These differences were
	confirmed by manual planimetry and were statistically significant
	whether tested based on difference or change, integrated over the
	volume of the ventricles. Other changes and group differences were
	consistent between the two analyses, e.g., reduction of white matter
	(including corpus callosum) and increase in CSF volume, and these
	are in agreement with established effects of alcoholism on brain
	structure. We conclude that intra-subject morphometry of longitudinal
	data is preferable to inter-subject morphometry for detecting dynamic
	changes due to a disease, especially when only small samples are
	available. Our analysis demonstrates that the distinction between
	group differences observed at a point in time vs. over time is not
	merely academic but can substantially reduce the validity of the
	outcomes of actual morphometric studies. This discrepancy in results
	underscores the importance of distinguishing between volume differences
	and volume changes in morphometric analyses.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal and progressive neurodegenerative
	disease that is accompanied by involuntary movements, cognitive dysfunction,
	and psychiatric symptoms. Although progressive striatal degeneration
	is known to occur, little is known about how the disease affects
	the cortex, including which cortical regions are affected, how degeneration
	proceeds, and the relationship of the cortical degeneration to clinical
	symptoms. The cortex has been difficult to study in neurodegenerative
	diseases primarily because of its complex folding patterns and regional
	variability; however, an understanding of how the cortex is affected
	by the disease may provide important new insights into it. METHODS:
	Novel automated surface reconstruction and high-resolution MR images
	of 11 patients with HD and 13 age-matched subjects were used to obtain
	cortical thickness measurements. The same analyses were performed
	on two postmortem brains to validate these methods. RESULTS: Regionally
	specific heterogeneous thinning of the cortical ribbon was found
	in subjects with HD. Thinning occurred early, differed among patients
	in different clinical stages of disease, and appeared to proceed
	from posterior to anterior cortical regions with disease progression.
	The sensorimotor region was statistically most affected. Measurements
	performed on MR images of autopsy brains analyzed similarly were
	within 0.25 mm of those obtained using traditional neuropathologic
	methods and were statistically indistinguishable. CONCLUSIONS: The
	authors propose that the cortex degenerates early in disease and
	that regionally selective cortical degeneration may explain the heterogeneity
	of clinical expression in HD. These measures might provide a sensitive
	prospective surrogate marker for clinical trials of neuroprotective
	medications.},

	a murine model for a mild BI-TBI that isolates low-level blast pressure
	effects to the brain without systemic injuries. An open-field explosives
	detonation was used to replicate, as closely as possible, low-level

	at both 4 and 7 m distance from the blast (5.5 and 2.5 PSI, respectively).
	At 30 days post-blast, clear differences were found in animals at
	both distances in the object recognition test, and in the 7 m group
	in the Y maze test. Using MRI, T1 weighted images showed an increased
	BBB permeability 1 month post-blast. DTI analysis showed an increase

	These changes correlated with sites of up-regulation of manganese

  abstract = {We present a novel skull-stripping algorithm based on a hybrid approach
	that combines watershed algorithms and deformable surface models.
	Our method takes advantage of the robustness of the former as well
	as the surface information available to the latter. The algorithm
	first localizes a single white matter voxel in a T1-weighted MRI
	image, and uses it to create a global minimum in the white matter
	before applying a watershed algorithm with a preflooding height.
	The watershed algorithm builds an initial estimate of the brain volume
	based on the three-dimensional connectivity of the white matter.
	This first step is robust, and performs well in the presence of intensity
	nonuniformities and noise, but may erode parts of the cortex that
	abut bright nonbrain structures such as the eye sockets, or may remove
	parts of the cerebellum. To correct these inaccuracies, a surface
	deformation process fits a smooth surface to the masked volume, allowing
	the incorporation of geometric constraints into the skull-stripping
	procedure. A statistical atlas, generated from a set of accurately
	segmented brains, is used to validate and potentially correct the
	segmentation, and the MRI intensity values are locally re-estimated
	at the boundary of the brain. Finally, a high-resolution surface
	deformation is performed that accurately matches the outer boundary
	of the brain, resulting in a robust and automated procedure. Studies
	by our group and others outperform other publicly available skull-stripping
	tools.},

	has also been used to derive the distribution of mean diffusivity,

	of the ellipsoidal (or spherical) model compared to an unrestricted
	linear model in which no specific shape is assumed for the diffusion
	process, and to estimate the signal-to-noise ratios in the original

	diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) datasets of clinical interest: a healthy
	volunteer, a patient with acute brain injury, and a patient with

	control subjects without memory complaints were investigated in resting-state
	condition with MRI at 1.5 Tesla. Functional coupling between brain

	between regional time-series. Local (cluster coefficient) and global

  abstract = {A crucial component of research on brain evolution has been the comparison
	of fossil endocranial surfaces with modern human and primate endocrania.
	The latter have generally been obtained by creating endocasts out
	of rubber latex shells filled with plaster. The extent to which the
	method of production introduces errors in endocast replicas is unknown.
	We demonstrate a powerful method of comparing complex shapes in 3-dimensions
	(3D) that is broadly applicable to a wide range of paleoanthropological
	questions. Pairs of virtual endocasts (VEs) created from high-resolution
	CT scans of corresponding latex/plaster endocasts and their associated
	crania were rigidly registered (aligned) in 3D space for two Homo
	sapiens and two Pan troglodytes specimens. Distances between each
	cranial VE and its corresponding latex/plaster VE were then mapped
	on a voxel-by-voxel basis. The results show that between 79.7\% and
	91.0\% of the voxels in the four latex/plaster VEs are within 2 mm
	of their corresponding cranial VEs surfaces. The average error is
	relatively small, and variation in the pattern of error across the
	surfaces appears to be generally random overall. However, inferior
	areas around the cranial base and the temporal poles were somewhat
	overestimated in both human and chimpanzee specimens, and the area
	overlaying Broca's area in humans was somewhat underestimated. This
	study gives an idea of the size of possible error inherent in latex/plaster
	endocasts, indicating the level of confidence we can have with studies
	relying on comparisons between them and, e.g., hominid fossil endocasts.},

  abstract = {Several algorithms for measuring the cortical thickness in the human
	brain from MR image volumes have been described in the literature,
	the majority of which rely on fitting deformable models to the inner
	and outer cortical surfaces. However, the constraints applied during
	the model fitting process in order to enforce spherical topology
	and to fit the outer cortical surface in narrow sulci, where the
	cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) channel may be obscured by partial voluming,
	may introduce bias in some circumstances, and greatly increase the
	processor time required. In this paper we describe an alternative,
	voxel based technique that measures the cortical thickness using
	inversion recovery anatomical MR images. Grey matter, white matter
	and CSF are identified through segmentation, and edge detection is
	used to identify the boundaries between these tissues. The cortical
	thickness is then measured along the local 3D surface normal at every
	voxel on the inner cortical surface. The method was applied to 119
	normal volunteers, and validated through extensive comparisons with
	published measurements of both cortical thickness and rate of thickness
	change with age. We conclude that the proposed technique is generally
	faster than deformable model-based alternatives, and free from the
	possibility of model bias, but suffers no reduction in accuracy.
	In particular, it will be applicable in data sets showing severe
	cortical atrophy, where thinning of the gyri leads to points of high
	curvature, and so the fitting of deformable models is problematic.},

	were labeled in MRI of 40 healthy, normal volunteers. This labeling
	was performed according to a set of protocols developed for this
	project. Pairs of raters were assigned to each structure and trained
	on the protocol for that structure. Each rater pair was tested for
	concordance on 6 of the 40 brains; once they had achieved reliability
	standards, they divided the task of delineating the remaining 34
	brains. The data were then spatially normalized to well-known templates
	using 3 popular algorithms: AIR5.2.5's nonlinear warp (Woods et al.,
	1998) paired with the ICBM452 Warp 5 atlas (Rex et al., 2003), FSL's
	FLIRT (Smith et al., 2004) was paired with its own template, a skull-stripped
	version of the ICBM152 T1 average; and SPM5's unified segmentation
	method (Ashburner and Friston, 2005) was paired with its canonical
	brain, the whole head ICBM152 T1 average. We thus produced 3 variants
	of our atlas, where each was constructed from 40 representative samples
	of a data processing stream that one might use for analysis. For

	were then resampled according to the computed transformations. We
	next computed averages at each voxel location to estimate the probability

	labeling of external data types registered into standard spaces;
	we also computed average intensity images and tissue density maps

	We performed a prospective longitudinal study of 30 adult patients
	admitted for subacute rehabilitation following severe traumatic brain

	weeks), and repeated in 23 of the patients at mean 12 months (9-15
	months) post-trauma. Using a region-of-interest-based approach, DTI
	parameters were compared to those of healthy matched controls, scanned
	during the same time period and rescanned with a similar interval
	as that of patients. At the initial scan, fractional anisotropy was
	reduced in all the investigated white matter regions in patients
	compared to controls (P <or= 0.01) due to decreased diffusivity parallel
	(lambda(parallel)) and increased diffusivity perpendicular (lambda(perpendicular))
	to axonal fibre direction. Fractional anisotropy in the cerebral
	peduncle correlated with approximately 1 year Glasgow outcome scale

	outcome with 76\% accuracy when taken alone, and with 100\% accuracy
	in combination with clinical evaluation by functional independence
	measure at the time of the first scan. At follow-up DTI, fractional
	anisotropy in patients had increased in the internal capsule and
	in centrum semiovale (P <or= 0.01) due to an interval increase of
	lambda(parallel) with unchanged lambda(perpendicular). In these regions,
	fractional anisotropy and lambda( parallel) reached normal or supranormal
	levels, primarily in patients with favourable outcome. In the cerebral
	peduncle and in corpus callosum, lambda(parallel) and lambda(perpendicular)
	both increased during the scan interval and, particularly in patients
	with unfavourable outcome, fractional anisotropy remained depressed.
	No significant DTI parameter changes over time were found in controls,

	might serve as a tool for revealing changes in the neural tissue

	genetic causes of cognitive impairment and developmental disability
	yet little is known about the neural bases of those challenges. Here
	we expand upon our previous neurocognitive studies by specifically
	investigating the hypothesis that changes in neural connectivity
	relate to cognitive impairment in children with the disorder.Whole
	brain analyses of multiple measures computed from diffusion tensor
	image data acquired from the brains of children with the disorder
	and typically developing controls. We also correlated diffusion tensor
	data with performance on a visuospatial cognitive task that taps
	spatial attention.Analyses revealed four common clusters, in the
	parietal and frontal lobes, that showed complementary patterns of
	connectivity in children with the deletion and typical controls.
	We interpreted these results as indicating differences in connective
	complexity to adjoining cortical regions that are critical to the
	cognitive functions in which affected children show impairments.
	Strong, and similarly opposing patterns of correlations between diffusion
	values in those clusters and spatial attention performance measures
	considerably strengthened that interpretation.Our results suggest
	that atypical development of connective patterns in the brains of
	children with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome indicate a neuropathology
	that is related to the visuospatial cognitive impairments that are
	commonly found in affected individuals.},

	whether neural communication may be affected in soldiers months after
	blast-related mTBI, and whether coordination of neural function is

	included an application of a new time-frequency based method for
	measuring electroencephalogram (EEG) phase synchronization (Aviyente
	et al., 2010) as well as fractional anisotropy measures of axonal
	tracts derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Nine soldiers

	subjects. Despite an absence of cognitive deficits, the blast-related
	mTBI group exhibited diminished EEG phase synchrony of lateral frontal
	sites with contralateral frontal brain regions suggesting diminished
	interhemispheric coordination of brain activity as a result of blast
	injury. For blast injured (i.e., blast-related mTBI) soldiers we
	found that EEG phase synchrony was associated with the structural
	integrity of white matter tracts of the frontal lobe (left anterior
	thalamic radiations and the forceps minor including the anterior
	corpus callosum). Analyses revealed that diminished EEG phase synchrony
	was not the consequence of combat-stress symptoms (e.g., post-traumatic
	stress and depression) and commonly prescribed medications. Results
	provide evidence for poor coordination of frontal neural function
	after blast injury that may be the consequence of damaged anterior

	which neuropathological feature comes first in the disease process,
	with early autopsy studies suggesting that NFT develop first, and
	more recent neuroimaging studies supporting the early role of amyloid
	beta (A?) deposition. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of A???
	and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) have been shown to serve as in
	vivo proxy measures of amyloid plaques and NFT, respectively. The
	aim of this study was to examine the association between CSF biomarkers
	and rate of atrophy in the precuneus and hippocampus. These regions
	were selected because the precuneus appears to be affected early
	and severely by A? deposition, and the hippocampus similarly by NFT
	pathology. We predicted (1) baseline A??? would be related to accelerated
	rate of cortical thinning in the precuneus and volume loss in the
	hippocampus, with the latter relationship expected to be weaker,
	(2) baseline p-tau(181p) would be related to accelerated rate of
	hippocampal atrophy and cortical thinning in the precuneus, with
	the latter relationship expected to be weaker. Using all ADNI cohorts,
	we fitted separate linear mixed-effects models for changes in hippocampus
	and precuneus longitudinal outcome measures with baseline CSF biomarkers
	modeled as predictors. Results partially supported our hypotheses:
	Both baseline p-tau(181p) and A??? were associated with hippocampal
	atrophy over time. Neither p-tau(181p) nor A??? were significantly
	related to cortical thinning in the precuneus over time. However,
	follow-up analyses demonstrated that having abnormal levels of both
	A??? and p-tau(181p) was associated with an accelerated rate of atrophy
	in both the hippocampus and precuneus. Results support early effects
	of A? in the Alzheimer's disease process, which are less apparent
	than and perhaps dependent on p-tau effects as the disease progresses.

	with deletion of approximately 20 contiguous genes on chromosome
	7. Detailed three-dimensional (3D) maps of cortical thickness, based
	on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 164 brain hemispheres,
	identified a delimited zone of right hemisphere perisylvian cortex
	that was thicker in WS than in matched controls, despite pervasive
	gray and white matter deficits and reduced total cerebral volumes.
	3D cortical surface models were extracted from 82 T1-weighted brain
	MRI scans (256 x 192 x 124 volumes) of 42 subjects with genetically
	confirmed WS (mean +/- SD, 29.2 +/- 9.0 years of age; 19 males, 23
	females) and 40 age-matched healthy controls (27.5 +/- 7.4 years
	of age; 16 males, 24 females). A cortical pattern-matching technique
	used 72 sulcal landmarks traced on each brain as anchors to align
	cortical thickness maps across subjects, build group average maps,
	and identify regions with altered cortical thickness in WS. Cortical
	models were remeshed in frequency space to compute their fractal
	dimension (surface complexity) for each hemisphere and lobe. Surface
	complexity was significantly increased in WS (p < 0.0015 and p <
	0.0014 for left and right hemispheres, respectively) and correlated
	with temporoparietal gyrification differences, classified via Steinmetz
	criteria. In WS, cortical thickness was increased by 5-10% in a circumscribed
	right hemisphere perisylvian and inferior temporal zone (p < 0.002).
	Spatially extended cortical regions were identified with increased
	complexity and thickness; cortical thickness and complexity were
	also positively correlated in controls (p < 0.03). These findings
	visualize cortical zones with altered anatomy in WS, which merit
	additional study with techniques to assess function and connectivity.},

  journal = {Hum Brain Mapp},
  year = {2012},
  month = {Nov},
  abstract = {Recent discussions within the neuroimaging community have highlighted
	the problematic presence of selection bias in experimental design.
	Although initially centering on the selection of voxels during the
	course of fMRI studies, we demonstrate how this bias can potentially
	corrupt voxel-based analyses. For such studies, template-based registration
	plays a critical role in which a representative template serves as
	the normalized space for group alignment. A standard approach maps
	each subject's image to a representative template before performing
	statistical comparisons between different groups. We analytically
	demonstrate that in these scenarios the popular sum of squared difference
	(SSD) intensity metric, implicitly surrogating as a quantification
	of anatomical alignment, instead explicitly maximizes effect size-an
	experimental design flaw referred to as "circularity bias." We illustrate
	how this selection bias varies in strength with the similarity metric
	used during registration under the hypothesis that while SSD-related
	metrics, such as Demons, will manifest similar effects, other metrics
	which are not formulated based on absolute intensity differences
	will produce less of an effect. Consequently, given the variability
	in voxel-based analysis outcomes with similarity metric choice, we
	caution researchers specifically in the use of SSD and SSD-related
	measures where normalization and statistical analysis involve the
	same image set. Instead, we advocate a more cautious approach where
	normalization of the individual subject images to the reference space
	occurs through corresponding image sets which are independent of
	statistical testing. Alternatively, one can use similarity terms
	that are less sensitive to this bias. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. © 2012

  abstract = {Previous contributions to both the research and open source software
	communities detailed a generalization of a fast scalar field fitting
	technique for cubic B-splines based on the work originally proposed
	by Lee . One advantage of our proposed generalized B-spline fitting
	approach is its immediate application to a class of nonrigid registration
	techniques frequently employed in medical image analysis. Specifically,
	these registration techniques fall under the rubric of free-form
	deformation (FFD) approaches in which the object to be registered
	is embedded within a B-spline object. The deformation of the B-spline
	object describes the transformation of the image registration solution.
	Representative of this class of techniques, and often cited within
	the relevant community, is the formulation of Rueckert who employed
	cubic splines with normalized mutual information to study breast
	deformation. Similar techniques from various groups provided incremental
	novelty in the form of disparate explicit regularization terms, as
	well as the employment of various image metrics and tailored optimization
	methods. For several algorithms, the underlying gradient-based optimization
	retained the essential characteristics of Rueckert's original contribution.
	The contribution which we provide in this paper is two-fold: 1) the
	observation that the generic FFD framework is intrinsically susceptible
	to problematic energy topographies and 2) that the standard gradient
	used in FFD image registration can be modified to a well-understood
	preconditioned form which substantially improves performance. This
	is demonstrated with theoretical discussion and comparative evaluation
	experimentation.},

  abstract = {Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a 3-D spinal deformity with
	uncertain etiology; abnormalities in brain development represent
	one of the possible explanatory concepts for its pathogenesis. The
	objective of this study is to investigate the brain maturation by
	thickness of cerebral cortex among female adolescents with and without
	idiopathic scoliosis. Fifty AIS patients with a typical right-thoracic
	curve pattern were compared with 40 age-matched healthy controls.
	Based on the T1-weighted magnetic resonance images, the thickness
	of cortical gray-matter was calculated using a well-validated surface
	measurement method. Focusing on adolescent participants within the
	age range with the frequent occurrences of AIS cases (i.e., 12 to
	17 years), we observed that the cortical thickness declined significantly
	in almost all cortical lobes in normal subjects (Spearman correlation<-0.4;
	P â¤ 0.05) except temporal lobe in LH, while in AIS patients this
	decline was weakly correlated with age (Spearman correlation>-0.4)
	and largely insignificant (P â¥ 0.05). Quadratic regression results
	expressed the detailed difference in the age-related cortical changing
	pattern between the two groups. In addition, focal cortical thickness
	was significantly different in AIS patients compared with healthy
	controls in areas involved in motor and vestibular functions as well
	as object recognition. The findings from this study imply a different
	thinning pattern of the cerebral cortex during adolescence in patients
	with AIS; this may be primary (i.e. etiopathogenetic) or secondary
	(i.e. adaptation) to the development of scoliosis.},

  abstract = {Arterial spin labeling (ASL) provides noninvasive measurement of tissue

	to imaging of myocardial blood flow. Although different cardiac phases
	can be synchronized using electrocardiography triggering, breath
	holding is generally required to minimize effects of respiratory
	motion during ASL scanning, which may be challenging in clinical
	populations. Here a free-breathing myocardial ASL technique with
	the potential for reliable clinical application is presented, by
	combining ASL with a navigator-gated, electrocardiography-triggered
	TrueFISP readout sequence. Dynamic myocardial perfusion signals were
	measured at multiple delay times that allowed simultaneous fitting
	of myocardial blood flow and arterial transit time. With the assist
	of a nonrigid motion correction program, the estimated mean myocardial
	blood flow was 1.00 ± 0.55 mL/g/min with a mean transit time of ?
	400 msec. The intraclass correlation coefficient of repeated scans
	was 0.89 with a mean within subject coefficient of variation of 22\%.
	Perfusion response during mild to moderate stress was further measured.
	The capability for noninvasive, free-breathing assessment of myocardial

  abstract = {We propose a simple but generally applicable approach to improving
	the accuracy of automatic image segmentation algorithms relative
	to manual segmentations. The approach is based on the hypothesis
	that a large fraction of the errors produced by automatic segmentation
	are systematic, i.e., occur consistently from subject to subject,
	and serves as a wrapper method around a given host segmentation method.
	The wrapper method attempts to learn the intensity, spatial and contextual
	patterns associated with systematic segmentation errors produced
	by the host method on training data for which manual segmentations
	are available. The method then attempts to correct such errors in
	segmentations produced by the host method on new images. One practical
	use of the proposed wrapper method is to adapt existing segmentation
	tools, without explicit modification, to imaging data and segmentation
	protocols that are different from those on which the tools were trained
	and tuned. An open-source implementation of the proposed wrapper
	method is provided, and can be applied to a wide range of image segmentation
	problems. The wrapper method is evaluated with four host brain MRI
	segmentation methods: hippocampus segmentation using FreeSurfer (Fischl
	et al., 2002); hippocampus segmentation using multi-atlas label fusion
	(Artaechevarria et al., 2009); brain extraction using BET (Smith,
	2002); and brain tissue segmentation using FAST (Zhang et al., 2001).
	The wrapper method generates 72\%, 14\%, 29\% and 21\% fewer erroneously
	segmented voxels than the respective host segmentation methods. In
	the hippocampus segmentation experiment with multi-atlas label fusion
	as the host method, the average Dice overlap between reference segmentations
	and segmentations produced by the wrapper method is 0.908 for normal
	controls and 0.893 for patients with mild cognitive impairment. Average
	Dice overlaps of 0.964, 0.905 and 0.951 are obtained for brain extraction,
	white matter segmentation and gray matter segmentation, respectively.},

	resolution T2-weighted magnetic resonance images that can be acquired
	in the routine clinical setting with under 5 min scan time. The method
	combines multi-atlas segmentation, similarity-weighted voting, and
	a novel learning-based bias correction technique to achieve excellent
	agreement with manual segmentation. Initial partitioning of MRI slices
	into hippocampal 'head', 'body' and 'tail' slices is the only input
	required from the user, necessitated by the nature of the underlying
	segmentation protocol. Dice overlap between manual and automatic
	segmentation is above 0.87 for the larger subfields, CA1 and dentate
	gyrus, and is competitive with the best results for whole-hippocampus
	segmentation in the literature. Intraclass correlation of volume
	measurements in CA1 and dentate gyrus is above 0.89. Overlap in smaller
	hippocampal subfields is lower in magnitude (0.54 for CA2, 0.62 for
	CA3, 0.77 for subiculum and 0.79 for entorhinal cortex) but comparable
	to overlap between manual segmentations by trained human raters.
	These results support the feasibility of subfield-specific hippocampal
	morphometry in clinical studies of memory and neurodegenerative disease.},

	a final representation of the cortical bounding surfaces and an automatic

	it has been achieved using low-dimensional registration methods in
	the large majority of clinical studies. This paper aims to motivate
	the use of high-dimensional normalization approaches by generating
	evidence of their impact on the findings of such studies. Using an

	normalization methods representing the current range of available

	normalization using full tensor information. Each method was assessed
	in terms of its ability to detect significant differences between
	ALS patients and controls. Our findings suggest that inadequate normalization
	with low-dimensional approaches can result in insufficient removal
	of shape differences which in turn can confound FA differences in
	a complex manner, and that utilizing high-dimensional normalization
	can both significantly minimize the confounding effect of shape differences
	to FA differences and provide a more complete description of WM differences
	in terms of both size and tissue architecture differences. We also
	found that high-dimensional approaches, by leveraging full tensor
	features instead of tensor-derived indices, can further improve the

  abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for
	statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images
	because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant
	nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based
	model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation--no spatial information
	is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined
	images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not
	the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias
	field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods
	produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden
	Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated
	by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which
	can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically,
	it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the
	HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way
	in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences
	of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in
	MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods
	are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based
	approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show
	that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into
	a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved.
	More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with
	other techniques. As an example, we show how the bias field correction
	algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into
	this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach
	for brain MR image segmentation.},

	difficult to differentiate clinically because of overlapping symptoms.
	Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measurements of fractional anisotropy
	(FA) can be useful in distinguishing the different patterns of white
	matter degradation between the two dementias. In this study, we performed
	MRI scans in a 4 Tesla MRI machine including T1-weighted structural
	images and diffusion tensor images in 18 patients with FTD, 18 patients
	with Alzheimer's disease and 19 cognitively normal (CN) controls.
	FA was measured selectively in specific fibre tracts (including corpus
	callosum, cingulum, uncinate and corticospinal tracts) as well as
	globally in a voxel-by-voxel analysis. Patients with FTD were associated
	with reductions of FA in frontal and temporal regions including the
	anterior corpus callosum (P < 0.001), bilateral anterior (left P
	< 0.001; right P = 0.005), descending (left P < 0.001; right P =
	0.003) cingulum tracts, and uncinate tracts (left P < 0.001; right
	P = 0.005), compared to controls. Patients with Alzheimer's disease
	were associated with reductions of FA in parietal, temporal and frontal
	regions including the left anterior (P = 0.003) and posterior (P
	= 0.002) cingulum tracts, bilateral descending cingulum tracts (P
	< 0.001) and left uncinate tracts (P < 0.001) compared to controls.
	When compared with Alzheimer's disease, FTD was associated with greater
	reductions of FA in frontal brain regions, whereas no region in Alzheimer's
	disease showed greater reductions of FA when compared to FTD. In
	conclusion, the regional patterns of anisotropy reduction in FTD
	and Alzheimer's disease compared to controls suggest a characteristic
	distribution of white matter degradation in each disease. Moreover,
	the white matter degradation seems to be more prominent in FTD than
	in Alzheimer's disease. Taken together, the results suggest that
	white matter degradation measured with DTI may improve the diagnostic
	differentiation between FTD and Alzheimer's disease.},
