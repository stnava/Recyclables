  abstract = {Although normalization of brain images is critical to the analysis
	of structural damage across individuals, loss of tissue due to focal
	lesions presents challenges to the available normalization algorithms.
	Until recently, cost function masking, as advocated by Brett and
	colleagues (2001), was the accepted method to overcome difficulties
	encountered when normalizing damaged brains; however, development
	of the unified segmentation approach for normalization in SPM5 (Ashburner
	\& Friston, 2005) offered an alternative. Crinion et al. (2007) demonstrated
	this approach produced normalization results without cost function
	masking that appeared to be robust to lesion effects when tested
	using the same simulated lesions studied by Brett et al. (2001).
	The present study sought to confirm the validity of this approach
	in brains with focal damage due to vascular events. To do so, we
	examined outcomes of normalization using unified segmentation with
	and without cost function masking in 49 brain images with chronic
	stroke. Lesion masks were created using two approaches (precise and
	rough drawings of lesion boundaries), and normalization was implemented
	with both smoothed and unsmoothed versions of the masks. We found
	that failure to employ cost function masking produced less accurate
	results in real and simulated lesions, compared to masked normalization,
	both in terms of deformation field displacement and voxelwise intensity
	differences. Additionally, unmasked normalization led to significant
	underestimation of lesion volume relative to all four masking conditions,
	especially in patients with large lesions. Taken together, these
	findings suggest cost function masking is still necessary when normalizing
	brain images with chronic infarcts.},

  abstract = {A number of conflicting claims have been advanced regarding the role
	of the left inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobe and posterior
	middle temporal gyrus in action recognition, driven in part by an
	ongoing debate about the capacities of putative mirror systems that
	match observed and planned actions. We report data from 43 left hemisphere
	stroke patients in two action recognition tasks in which they heard
	and saw an action word ('hammering') and selected from two videoclips
	the one corresponding to the word. In the spatial recognition task,
	foils contained errors of body posture or movement amplitude/timing.
	In the semantic recognition task, foils were semantically related
	(sawing). Participants also performed a comprehension control task
	requiring matching of the same verbs to objects (hammer). Using regression
	analyses controlling for both the comprehension control task and
	lesion volume, we demonstrated that performance in the semantic gesture
	recognition task was predicted by per cent damage to the posterior
	temporal lobe, whereas the spatial gesture recognition task was predicted
	by per cent damage to the inferior parietal lobule. A whole-brain
	voxel-based lesion symptom-mapping analysis suggested that the semantic
	and spatial gesture recognition tasks were associated with lesioned
	voxels in the posterior middle temporal gyrus and inferior parietal
	lobule, respectively. The posterior middle temporal gyrus appears
	to serve as a central node in the association of actions and meanings.
	The inferior parietal lobule, held to be a homologue of the monkey
	parietal mirror neuron system, is critical for encoding object-related
	postures and movements, a relatively circumscribed aspect of gesture
	recognition. The inferior frontal gyrus, on the other hand, was not
	predictive of performance in any task, suggesting that previous claims
	regarding its role in action recognition may require refinement.},

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most common causes of
	long-term disability. Despite the importance of identifying neuropathology
	in individuals with chronic TBI, methodological challenges posed
	at the stage of inter-subject image registration have hampered previous
	voxel-based MRI studies from providing a clear pattern of structural
	atrophy after TBI. We used a novel symmetric diffeomorphic image
	normalization method to conduct a tensor-based morphometry (TBM)
	study of TBI. The key advantage of this method is that it simultaneously
	estimates an optimal template brain and topology preserving deformations
	between this template and individual subject brains. Detailed patterns
	of atrophies are then revealed by statistically contrasting control
	and subject deformations to the template space. Participants were
	29 survivors of TBI and 20 control subjects who were matched in terms
	of age, gender, education, and ethnicity. Localized volume losses
	were found most prominently in white matter regions and the subcortical
	nuclei including the thalamus, the midbrain, the corpus callosum,
	the mid- and posterior cingulate cortices, and the caudate. Significant
	voxel-wise volume loss clusters were also detected in the cerebellum
	and the frontal/temporal neocortices. Volume enlargements were identified
	largely in ventricular regions. A similar pattern of results was
	observed in a subgroup analysis where we restricted our analysis
	to the 17 TBI participants who had no macroscopic focal lesions (total
	lesion volume >1.5 cm(3)). The current study confirms, extends, and
	partly challenges previous structural MRI studies in chronic TBI.
	By demonstrating that a large deformation image registration technique
	can be successfully combined with TBM to identify TBI-induced diffuse
	structural changes with greater precision, our approach is expected
	to increase the sensitivity of future studies examining brain-behavior
	relationships in the TBI population.},

	of crude spatial registration methods, exclusion of subjects with
	substantial focal lesions, and exposure to ionizing radiation, which
	limits repeated assessments. This study aimed to overcome those obstacles
	by measuring absolute CBF with an arterial spin labeling perfusion
	fMRI technique, and using an image preprocessing protocol that is
	optimized for brains with mixed diffuse and focal injuries characteristic
	of moderate and severe TBI. Resting state CBF was quantified in 27
	individuals with moderate to severe TBI in the chronic stage, and
	22 demographically matched healthy controls. In addition to global
	CBF reductions in the TBI subjects, more prominent regional hypoperfusion
	was found in the posterior cingulate cortices, the thalami, and multiple
	locations in the frontal cortices. Diffuse injury, as assessed by
	tensor-based morphometry, was mainly associated with reduced CBF
	in the posterior cingulate cortices and the thalami, where the greatest
	volume losses were detected. Hypoperfusion in superior and middle
	frontal cortices, in contrast, was associated with focal lesions.
	These results suggest that structural lesions, both focal and diffuse,
	are the main contributors to the absolute CBF alterations seen in
	chronic TBI, and that CBF may serve as a tool to assess functioning
	neuronal volume. We also speculate that resting reductions in posterior
	cingulate perfusion may reflect alterations in the default-mode network,
	and may contribute to the attentional deficits common in TBI.},

  abstract = {The objective of the current study was to develop a semi-automated
	method to register and parcellate lesioned brains in a surface space
	with anatomical accuracy, facilitating group-level fMRI analyses
	in patients with large cortical strokes.Thirteen chronic patients
	with a single large left hemisphere stroke were included in the study.
	Our "virtual brain transplantation" (VBT) approach is based on pre-processing
	high resolution anatomical T1-weighted brain images by "filling in"
	the lesion with "transplanted virtual tissue" from the non-stroke
	hemisphere, providing "normal" anatomical landmarks for standard
	alignment and inflation algorithms developed for healthy individuals.
	Biological validation of the approach was performed by quantifying
	in Freesurfer space the areas of 12 hand-drawn sulci found inside
	and outside the stroke following "transplantation".Our results show
	no difference in the Freesurfer parcellation of 12 different regions
	when comparing a lesioned hemisphere with the non-lesioned hemisphere,
	attesting for the validity of the anatomical classification in the
	stroke hemisphere. As consequence of the anatomical precision, this
	method permits a more detailed and quantifiable anatomical description
	of the regions affected directly by the stroke.This method permits
	accurate surface reconstruction of the injured hemisphere after stroke
	by making it possible to extract the cortical surface from these
	images and to utilize this in software modules (FreeSurfer) specialized
	for aligning cortical surfaces using high-dimensionality warping
	algorithms. In addition, it permits quantifying, within bounds, the
	extent to which the lesion in question is associated with damage
	to particular regions of the cortical surface, information that is
	of explanatory value in models that attempt to explain brain-behavior
	relations using lesion analysis.},

  journal = {Hum Brain Mapp},
  year = {2012},
  month = {Nov},
  abstract = {Recent discussions within the neuroimaging community have highlighted
	the problematic presence of selection bias in experimental design.
	Although initially centering on the selection of voxels during the
	course of fMRI studies, we demonstrate how this bias can potentially
	corrupt voxel-based analyses. For such studies, template-based registration
	plays a critical role in which a representative template serves as
	the normalized space for group alignment. A standard approach maps
	each subject's image to a representative template before performing
	statistical comparisons between different groups. We analytically
	demonstrate that in these scenarios the popular sum of squared difference
	(SSD) intensity metric, implicitly surrogating as a quantification
	of anatomical alignment, instead explicitly maximizes effect size-an
	experimental design flaw referred to as "circularity bias." We illustrate
	how this selection bias varies in strength with the similarity metric
	used during registration under the hypothesis that while SSD-related
	metrics, such as Demons, will manifest similar effects, other metrics
	which are not formulated based on absolute intensity differences
	will produce less of an effect. Consequently, given the variability
	in voxel-based analysis outcomes with similarity metric choice, we
	caution researchers specifically in the use of SSD and SSD-related
	measures where normalization and statistical analysis involve the
	same image set. Instead, we advocate a more cautious approach where
	normalization of the individual subject images to the reference space
	occurs through corresponding image sets which are independent of
	statistical testing. Alternatively, one can use similarity terms
	that are less sensitive to this bias. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. © 2012

  abstract = {Whole brain fMRI analyses rarely include the entire brain because
	of missing data that result from data acquisition limits and susceptibility
	artifact, in particular. This missing data problem is typically addressed
	by omitting voxels from analysis, which may exclude brain regions
	that are of theoretical interest and increase the potential for Type
	II error at cortical boundaries or Type I error when spatial thresholds
	are used to establish significance. Imputation could significantly
	expand statistical map coverage, increase power, and enhance interpretations
	of fMRI results. We examined multiple imputation for group level
	analyses of missing fMRI data using methods that leverage the spatial
	information in fMRI datasets for both real and simulated data. Available
	case analysis, neighbor replacement, and regression based imputation
	approaches were compared in a general linear model framework to determine
	the extent to which these methods quantitatively (effect size) and
	qualitatively (spatial coverage) increased the sensitivity of group
	analyses. In both real and simulated data analysis, multiple imputation
	provided 1) variance that was most similar to estimates for voxels
	with no missing data, 2) fewer false positive errors in comparison
	to mean replacement, and 3) fewer false negative errors in comparison
	to available case analysis. Compared to the standard analysis approach
	of omitting voxels with missing data, imputation methods increased
	brain coverage in this study by 35\% (from 33,323 to 45,071 voxels).
	In addition, multiple imputation increased the size of significant
	clusters by 58\% and number of significant clusters across statistical
	thresholds, compared to the standard voxel omission approach. While
	neighbor replacement produced similar results, we recommend multiple
	imputation because it uses an informed sampling distribution to deal
	with missing data across subjects that can include neighbor values
	and other predictors. Multiple imputation is anticipated to be particularly
	useful for 1) large fMRI data sets with inconsistent missing voxels
	across subjects and 2) addressing the problem of increased artifact
	at ultra-high field, which significantly limit the extent of whole
	brain coverage and interpretations of results.},

	study by our group used voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM)
	methods with 64 patients with chronic aphasia to identify voxels
	that carry an association with semantic errors. The strongest associations
	were found in the left anterior temporal lobe (L-ATL), in the mid-
